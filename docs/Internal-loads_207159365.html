This can result in &lsquo;legacy loads&rsquo;. Most attention has been focused on internal loading of P because of its importance in causing eutrophication and its facultative binding to minerals in lake sediments. However, internal N loading can be substantial as well.</p><p><strong>Geochemistry Effects on Nutrient Release From the Sediment</strong></p><p>Environmental conditions can favour the release of nutrients from the sediment on the lake bottom, especially when in contact with anoxic bottom waters in lakes that thermally stratify for a substantial part of the year. Potentially large amounts of P can be released back to the water column which can eventually be entrained into the productive euphotic zone of the lakes following the breakdown of stratification.</p><p><strong>Accumulation of Dissolved P in Hypolimnia</strong></p><p>Several studies have estimated internal loading from the accumulation of P in the hypolimnion in stratified lakes during the summer. Possible pathways of estimation are:</p><ul><li><p>A mass balance model</p></li><li><p>Measuring phosphorus during the winter mixing period and integrating over depth</p></li></ul><p>The accumulation of nutrients in the hypolimnion may, apart from internal loading, also result from sinking out and decomposition of algal matter below the thermocline and, without access to the surface layer, it is prevented from flushing through the outlet.</p><p><strong>pH-Dependent P Release</strong></p><p>Elevated water pH levels above about 9, as can occur in response to intense algal blooms, can also enhance P fluxes from sediments to water. High pH caused by planktonic cyanobacterial blooms has been shown to<br />dissolve metal-hydroxide-bound P in lake sediments while dissolved inorganic P was being taken up by the cyanobacteria.</p><p><strong>Wind-Induced Nutrient Resuspension </strong></p><p>In shallow lakes, P release can also be caused by wind mixing and resuspension as is probably the case in Lake Omapere in Northland. The most likely explanation for the high internal loading in this lake is that nutrients deposited in the sediments in the past were recycled back into the water column either by release under anoxic bottom-water conditions or by sediment resuspension and pore water entrainment during windy conditions.<br /><em><strong><span data-colorid="p8033qxdhq">How to measure and estimate?</span></strong></em></p><p><strong>N-Fixation </strong><br />Terrestrial nitrogen fixers such as gorse and broom fix and leak substantial amounts<br />of N and may contribute up to 200 kg N/ha*y to the nutrient load from New Zealand catchments. Nitrogen fixation can also occur in lakes, by floating weeds as well as planktonic N-fixing cyanobacteria. Nitrogen-fixing species of cyanobacteria may then enhance N concentrations, but N-fixation is rarely taken into account in lake N budgets because of lack of information on fixation rates. <br /></p>
