                    <p>We applied the riparian management DST to a case study catchment to identify the likely effectiveness of three different riparian mitigation options across the landscape for four water quality variables. This assessment followed the methodology detailed <a href="Estimating-the-potential-water-quality-and-habitat-response-to-Riparian-Buffers_263716865.html" data-linked-resource-id="263716865" data-linked-resource-version="8" data-linked-resource-type="page">here</a>.

This analysis provides a demonstration of the riparian management DST and shows how it could be used to prioritise reaches in the catchment for placing monitoring sites. All analyses were conducted using R.</p><p>Our application of the riparian management DST focused on a catchment in Taranaki, with three main sub-catchments (Figure 1). This catchment was chosen because we had access to underlying physical and water quality data to allow the models to be run. In each mitigation scenario, we applied the mitigation to the central sub-catchment and left the remaining two sub-catchments unmitigated. We assumed that the water quality conditions in the unmitigated sub-catchments were constant over time.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="340" loading="lazy" src="attachments/255459372/460095489.png?width=340" data-image-src="attachments/255459372/460095489.png" data-height="212" data-width="425" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="460095489" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="catchment_map.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="255459372" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="1798cd64-82ad-484b-ab89-ad95ddc99270" data-media-type="file"></span><p><em>Figure 1.

What is evident from these figures is that the fencing mitigation scenario is only likely to be effective at reducing TSS, with no impact on shade, water temperature or periphyton cover. In contrast, the grass and mixed buffer mitigation scenarios are expected to result in improvements in all four water quality variables, although greater improvements are likely with a mixed buffer for shade and periphyton in some parts of the catchment. It is important to note that we haven’t considered the effects of the mitigation scenarios on nutrients, and the associated links with periphyton growth, in this demonstration.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/255459372/460128281.png" data-image-src="attachments/255459372/460128281.png" data-height="397" data-width="708" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="460128281" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="mitigation_outcomes_maturity.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="255459372" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="31c7655e-b89e-4fd3-a349-81acbc2b7181" data-media-type="file"></span><p><em>Figure 2.

For the purposes of this demonstration, we used the expected reduction in each water quality variable at each reach, with the standard deviation calculated as the reach reduction multiplied by a random number between 0.8 - 1.2. The results presented below assume a Type I error of 0.05. For each scenario, we calculated the power to detect the expected reduction at specified time periods after the mitigation has matured (i.e., become fully established; fencing &amp; grass buffers - 1 year, mixed buffer - 10 years), assuming a monthly sampling regime. We have assumed that the mitigation is fully effective at mitigating each of the water quality variables at this time and have not considered lag effects.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="680" loading="lazy" src="attachments/255459372/460128297.png?width=680" data-image-src="attachments/255459372/460128297.png" data-height="340" data-width="708" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="460128297" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="power_given_5 years.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="255459372" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="e35e2b95-1bb5-4972-9d6b-e1405fb82de1" data-media-type="file"></span><p><em>Figure 4.

Increased power was associated with greater expected magnitudes of reduction. For example, we will have greater power to detect reductions in TSS because those reductions are expected to be greater. While there appears to be little difference in power between the grass and mixed buffer scenarios, it is apparent that we would be unlikely to detect an effect of these mitigation actions on water temperature and periphyton after five years of the mitigations being fully effective (i.e., six years after implementation of the grass buffer and 15 years after implementation of the mixed buffer). This analysis also highlights that the location of reaches within the stream network with the highest power also varies by water quality variable, again linked to the expected reduction in state.  While the power to detect an statistically significant reduction increases with the number of samples taken (Figure 5), we may still be unlikely to detect a reduction in some variables even after 10 years of monitoring.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="564" loading="lazy" src="attachments/255459372/479363088.png?width=564" data-image-src="attachments/255459372/479363088.png" data-height="588" data-width="540" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="479363088" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="power_given_1_5_10 years_ppt.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="255459372" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="7ee02b2b-1c1c-46f9-af8f-d06404cee312" data-media-type="file"></span><p><em>Figure 5.

The analysis assumes a monthly sampling regime.</em></p><h2 id="CaseStudy-RiparianManagementDST-Designingamonitoringnetwork">Designing a monitoring network</h2><p>The third aspect of this demonstration aims to identify parts of the catchment that may be most effective for undertaking monitoring to detect improvements in water quality state in relation to the mitigation actions.  Here we have taken the results of the power analyses for each of the water quality variables and calculated summary statistics (minimum, mean, maximum) across each time period to identify where the power is greatest (Figure 6). High values of maximum power identify reaches where we would be likely to detect the expected reduction in at least one of the monitored water quality variables, while the high values of minimum power can be used to identify reaches where a change is likely to be detected for all four water quality variables. The minimum and maximum values for the fencing scenario are the same as we only expect to see a reduction in TSS.</p><p>As expected, the power to detect a reduction increases with the length of the monitoring period and is greater where the expected reductions across all variables are greater. The maximum power plots indicate that we will likely detect a significant reduction in any one of the measured variables anywhere within the mitigated sub-catchment five years after mitigation for the grass or mixed buffers. In contrast, ten years of sampling would be required for the fencing mitigation scenario and reductions would be more likely to be detected in lower order reaches in the upper catchment. Note however that the fencing results are based solely on reductions in TSS as fencing for stock exclusion is not considered effective for reducing shade, temperature or periphyton (Figure 2 &amp; Figure 3). In all cases, establishing a monitoring site right at the bottom of the catchment is likely to be ineffective at detecting reductions associated with the mitigations as there is very low power. This effect is largely due to the 'diluting' effects of the unmitigated sub-catchments.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="564" loading="lazy" src="attachments/255459372/479232016.png?width=564" data-image-src="attachments/255459372/479232016.png" data-height="539" data-width="540" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="479232016" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="max_min_power_ppt.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="255459372" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="ed176d72-e09b-455f-94bc-14d43ad52836" data-media-type="file"></span><p><em>Figure 6.
