                    <p>Developing an appropriate monitoring network is a key step in assessing the effectiveness of mitigation actions. The location and density of monitoring sites, as well as the frequency and duration of monitoring, can have a large impact on our ability to detect changes in values of interest due to mitigation. The ideal location of sites will be dependent on the objectives of the mitigation and the associated monitoring program. While there is often a temptation to rely on existing monitoring sites or networks, these have often been established with a different set of objectives in mind and are often not appropriately located. </p><p>We note here that monitoring can be separated into ‘result’ and ‘outcome’ monitoring. Result monitoring measures the effectiveness of the mitigation action (e.g., growth of riparian planting) while outcome monitoring measures the benefits of mitigation actions for the wider habitat community or ecosystem (e.g., water quality). We specifically focus on network design for outcome monitoring here but note that it is also important to undertake result monitoring to ensure that the mitigation actions are working as intended. In all cases, the <a href="Power-analysis_140935209.html" data-linked-resource-id="140935209" data-linked-resource-version="20" data-linked-resource-type="page">number of sites/samples required to detect an effect</a> will be affected by the variability in the monitored variable and the frequency of sampling, as well as lag times associated with mitigation establishment and/or ecosystem responses. </p><p>We briefly summarise several approaches for designing monitoring networks below. Here we primarily concentrate on designing monitoring to detect the effects of mitigation rather than long-term State of the Environment (SOE) monitoring. </p><p>The local effect of mitigations are often be assessed by comparing the observed values of a variable of interest at a mitigated site with those at an unmitigated sites. In these situations, monitoring will typically occur at or close to the mitigation (impact) site using one of the methods described below.</p><ul><li><p><em>Intervention analysis (IA)</em> is a method to compare a time series of measured values at an <em>impact </em>site observed <em>before </em>a mitigation has been undertaken to measured values <em>after </em>the mitigation. A commonly used monitoring design for assessing the effectiveness of mitigations is the <em>Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) </em>approach, where measurements at the impact site are compared to roughly simultaneous measurements at one or more <em>control </em>sites that are not expected to be affected by the mitigation. The expectation is that the control and impact sites will be similar as possible in all aspects except the treatment of interest, with uncertainty arising from sampling error and natural temporal processes causing variation in the response variable. In practise, BACI designs can be hard to implement for environmental monitoring as it is often difficult to find two sites that have the same environmental conditions.</p></li><li><p><em>Impact vs reference sites (IVRS) </em>uses observations at the impact site and several controls at one or more times in before and after periods. In essence this summarizes all the data from a site into a single number (e.g., average after value - average before value) and bases uncertainty measurement on variation among control sites, rather than over time. Ideally, reference sites should be assigned randomly but this is rarely the case. </p></li></ul><p>Assessing the effects of catchment-scale mitigations may require many sites located throughout the catchment to understand the effectiveness of mitigation actions. Where possible, information about the degree of mitigation at each site should be recorded to help develop understanding about the relationships between the mitigation and the monitored variables. Catchment-scale monitoring networks may be designed using a range of approaches (USA-EPA, 2002), including randomised locations, sites stratified proportionally within environmental or geographic classes (Larsen et al. 2007, Olsen et al. 2012) or optimised to reduce redundancy within the network (Camara et al. 2020).
