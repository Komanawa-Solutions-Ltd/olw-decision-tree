(2020) </a>highlight the challenges of evaluating the effects of environmental policy on water resources given the dynamic interactions between people and water.  The authors note that an ideal experiment would circumvent the problem of confounding variables by removing biases between treatment and control groups, but in in hydrology this is difficult to achieve because the causal effects of unobserved confounding factors cannot be quantified.</p><p>The issue of confounding variables is a key challenge when evaluating the effects of nitrogen loss mitigations in catchments with a land use intensification history and relatively slow travel times through the vadose zone and saturated aquifer to water resource receptors. Nitrate concentrations may either  be increasing or have the potential to increase at monitoring sites within such catchments and hence they are often key focus areas for implementation of mitigation actions. The hydrological lags times mean that nitrate concentrations may continue to increase, or could remain static or decrease only slightly, despite mitigation implementation and the associated reduction in nitrogen leaching rates. This is due to the continued arrival of additional nitrogen at a monitoring site via slower flow paths and from more distant parts of the catchment where past land use intensification has occurred. </p><p>Failure to account for land use history and hydrological lags therefore leads to an increased likelihood of statistical error when evaluating the efficacy of nitrogen loss mitigations on concentrations at monitoring sites.  Evaluation of land use and nitrogen load history and hydrological lag times is critical when designing a mitigation efficacy monitoring system.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019WR026166" rel="nofollow">Penny et al., 2020</a> note that:</p><p><em>Hydrologists often respond to this challenge by considering causal effects in terms of counterfactuals: Hypothetical scenarios of what would have occurred under causal conditions that differ from reality (</em><a href="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMDF/pages/140673108/Counterfactual+analysis" rel="nofollow">Lewis, 1973, 2004)</a><em>. The counterfactual theory of causation asserts that the causal effect of a driver is the difference between the actual outcome and the hypothetical outcome of the counterfactual scenario in which the driver takes on a different value or is excluded entirely. Counterfactuals are commonly used in hydrology to assess causal relationships, typically through observing or modeling alternate scenarios</em>.</p><h2 id="FCIanalysistool-Forward-lookingcounterfactualinferencemethod">Forward-looking counterfactual inference method</h2><p>Our method uses an approach we refer to as forward-looking counterfactual inference (FCI) to explore whether the effectiveness of N loss mitigations could potentially be determinable at some point in the future by using counterfactual inference at that time. The FCI method is summarised below. </p><ol><li><p>Collect water samples at preferred monitoring locations for water age tracer analysis. Preferred locations will typically be existing monitoring sites where water quality targets have been defined.</p></li><li><p>Use one or more age distribution model to evaluate the possible range of age distributions that are consistent with the interpreted mean residence times (MRTs) and with the conceptual understanding of the hydrological system. A binary mixing model could be used, for instance, to represent the potential range of water source components that have travelled to a monitoring site via rapid and slow transport pathways. Determine the ELT (see <a href="Lag-time-analysis_49348614.html" data-linked-resource-id="49348614" data-linked-resource-version="12" data-linked-resource-type="page">here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Delineate the catchment area for the monitoring site (see <a href="Groundwater-catchment-delineation_140738652.html" data-linked-resource-id="140738652" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">guidance</a>) </p></li><li><p>Develop a credible range of year-by-year N load leaching rates for the ELT period.

Adjust the age distribution model parameters and N load history data to generate best fit, upper and lower N concentration/load time series which are consistent with the current measured nitrate concentration, after accounting for groundwater and in-stream attenuation where applicable and giving due consideration to the impact of inter-annual climate variability on the measured data</p></li><li><p>Calculate the possible range of future nitrate concentrations using future N load projections in the absence of mitigation (the counterfactual)</p></li><li><p>Calculate the possible range of future nitrate concentrations for the planned mitigation (e.g. 30% reduction in catchment N load reduction implemented in 2022). </p></li><li><p>Analyse results to determine whether post-mitigation nitrate concentrations are likely to fall within the counterfactual range.
