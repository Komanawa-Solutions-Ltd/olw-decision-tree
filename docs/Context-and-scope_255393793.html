                    <p>To ensure the vitality of wai/freshwater is maintained or enhanced, land stewards need to be confident that their actions will be effective. In partnership with central government, the Our Land and Water (OLW) National Science Challenge (Toitū te Whenua Toiora te Wai) has identified critical knowledge gaps in the design of environmental monitoring capable of verifying the impact of action on the ground as well as the most appropriate technologies for facilitating verification of actions.</p><p>As part of its Future Landscapes research theme, OLW has established three streams of work:</p><p><u>Working group 1</u>: Monitoring Design: The design of environmental monitoring programmes to enable a holistic and more certain understanding of freshwater outcomes resulting from land management actions taken within a catchment or a freshwater management unit (FMU).</p><p><u>Working group 2</u>: Monitoring Technology Defining what technologies are available (or soon will be) that can be successfully used for the measurement of holistic freshwater values, as related to freshwater use or contaminant discharge; with specific regard to how useful these technologies would be for regulating water use or contaminant discharge.</p><p><u>Working Group 3</u>: Enacting Te Mana o te Wai through Mātauranga Māori. Ensuring the integrity of Te Mana o te Wai is upheld, supporting the mauri of our wai to thrive and flourish through creating the infrastructure and tools needed to ensure that Te Mana o te Wai is given effect in its implementation and how it is able to lead monitoring of freshwater quantity and quality through the mana whenua of that place/ waters.</p><p>This page relates to Group 1 (Monitoring Design).</p><p><u>Overall project aim</u>: The design of environmental monitoring programmes to enable a holistic and more certain understanding of freshwater outcomes resulting from land management actions taken within a catchment or a freshwater management unit (FMU).</p><p><u>Key research topics</u> addressed by the project are:</p><ol><li><p>Review existing sources of environmental data and monitoring networks and their purpose and objectives. The review should focus on identifying catchments/examples of monitoring programmes specifically focused on management actions aiming at improving freshwater quality and/or ecological outcomes;</p></li><li><p>Develop a nationally consistent framework for the design of monitoring programmes to assess the effectiveness of on-the- ground management actions in affecting the state and direction of travel for a range of freshwater environmental indicators of ecological, recreational and cultural values. The framework must be applicable nationally and be consistent with the principles of Te Mana o te Wai;</p></li><li><p>Test and verify the Monitoring Design Framework in at least three catchments or sub-catchments that cover a range of characteristics and conditions (including exemplar At Risk Catchments). This means applying the Framework to develop monitoring programmes in each of these catchments or sub-catchments, but excludes the implementation of the monitoring programmes.</p></li></ol><p>The expected level of readiness is that of a “proof of concept” monitoring design framework, as opposed to a fully end-user ready tool.</p><p><u>End-users</u>: The Advisory Group identified Regional Councils, Iwi, and multi-agency catchment groups as the key end users for the MDF. A reasonably high level of end user technical proficiency should be assumed for the initial development of the project. A “simplified” module may be developed in the future</p><p>The project’s scope <u>includes</u>:</p><ul><li><p>All freshwater systems, including groundwater;</p></li><li><p>A range of on-the-ground management actions, including actions taken on land (e.g. farm management), at the land/water interface (e.g. riparian management) and within the waterbodies (e.g. in-lake management).</p></li><li><p>The monitoring of freshwater indicators relating to ecological, recreational and cultural freshwater values.</p></li></ul><p>The scope <u>does not include</u>:</p><ul><li><p>Defining what mitigation actions should happen, where or when. These are/will be established separately, and are thus treated as an input into the Monitoring Design Framework; </p></li><li><p>Defining or identifying freshwater Values, Objectives or outcomes for a waterbody or a catchment. This is a complex process mandated by the NPSFM and falls outside the scope of this project. Again, it is assumed that the freshwater Values, and objectives will be identified separately and are treated as an input into the Monitoring Design Framework</p></li><li><p>Policy or planning instruments and policy effectiveness monitoring;</p></li><li><p>State of the environment monitoring;</p></li><li><p>Establishing dose-response relationships (e.g. between water quality and ecological indicators);</p></li><li><p>The development of catchment models;</p></li><li><p>The development of field protocols (rather reference is made to existing national standards or protocols);</p></li><li><p>Urban, estuarine or coastal environments</p></li><li><p> The development of an interactive, end-user ready platform/interface</p></li></ul><p> Further detail regarding the working principles and scope of WG1 are provided in the <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="4f30fd81-589d-4151-9665-960fc79b82e6">EOI document.</span></p><p /><p />
