                    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Riparian restoration through streamside fencing and plant re-establishment is a common approach to mitigate the negative effects of land use on in-stream values. Riparian planting and fencing is assumed to mitigate the delivery of excess sediment, nutrients (direct and diffuse) and light into streams with the outcome being improved water quality.  Riparian planting is also assumed to provide terrestrial benefits, such as enhanced biodiversity. The presence of established riparian plants and fencing is linked to measures of good water quality, but very few studies, if any, have quantified the rate of recovery of in-stream outcomes relative to changes in riparian inputs.</p><p>The <em><strong>recovery pathway is unlikely to be the same as the impact pathway</strong></em> due to the interaction among pollutants (driving variables) and hysteresis (temporal lag). However, because recovery pathways are yet to be quantified, we rely on the impact pathway to provide a best estimate of the relationship between drivers and response variables. This estimate is then guided by hypothetical recovery curves to approximate when an improvement is likely to be detected. Note, response variables are attributes that provide measures of stream values such as Ecosystem Health, Mahinga kai and Recreation.</p><p><strong>Quantifying the impact pathway</strong></p><p>The impact pathway between driver and response variables is complex (Figure 1). Each driver directy affects primary response variables which in turn interact to affect secondary and tertiary response variables. The relative influence of each variable is dependent on i) the current state of the variable, because the relationship is not always linear, and ii) the environmental setting, because other factors can mediate interactions among variables. For example, sediment input directly influences the amount of sediment deposited on the stream bed, but a 20% increase in deposited sediment will affect a stream with 5% existing deposited sediment more than it will a stream with 60% deposited sediment. Further, a 20% increase in deposited sediment will have minimal affect on a fish community limited by wetted habitat due to flow allocation or a downstream barrier to migratory species. Therefore the relative efficacy of riparian mitigation on in-stream response variables is dependent on current state and environmental setting.</p><p /><p>Figure 6 – Conceptual network of the relationship between primary drivers and in-stream response variables.</p><p>The following information can be used to <em><strong>estimate the relative efficacy of riparian mitigation on in-stream response variables </strong></em>via the pathway of sediment, shade, and nutrient effects (i.e. the primary factors influenced by riparian fencing and planting). It is based on best available information, which is referenced. A <em><strong>major assumption is that there are no other factors present that limit recovery</strong></em>, such as insufficient wetted habitat due to habitat or flow alteration, barriers limiting dispersal, or toxicants inhibiting life.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sediment</strong></p><p>Sediment load determines the amount of deposited and suspended sediment in streams, which in turn shapes the streambed (and receiving environments), the physical nature of water and delivers nutrients. Excess sediment can smother benthic and interstitial habitat and affect the growth and survival of aquatic plants and animals. Franklin et al (2019) explored the relationship between suspended and deposited sediment and measures of macroinvertebrates and fish to derive national sediment criteria. Key points include:</p><ul><li><p>The amount of in-stream sediment varies greatly across the country, naturally due to geology, slope and stream flow, and also due to land use impacts</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The relationship between sediment and macroinvertebrates/fish metrics is dependent on expected reference state (i.e. natural variability) and current state (i.e. level of degradation)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Changes in fish and macroinvertebrates can occur across a wide gradient of possible sediment values</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Regression analyses suggest a ~7% decrease in macroinvertebrate metrics (e.g. MCI, sedMCI, %EPT) is correlated with a 7-550% increase in deposited sediment cover or 20-2000% increase in turbidity.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Community deviation analysis suggests a ~7% change in macroinvertebrate composition is associated with 140-500% increase in deposited sediment (up to 30% cover), and a ~7% change in fish composition is associated with 15-31% increase in turbidity (up to 10 NTU).</p></li></ul><p>Results from Franklin et al (2019) and further technical reports that supported the development of a sediment attribute for the NPSFM (see <a class="external-link" href="https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/fresh-water/further-analyses-of-fine-sediment-attributes-support-development-of-nps" rel="nofollow">https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/fresh-water/further-analyses-of-fine-sediment-attributes-support-development-of-nps</a>) are consistent with previous studies which show macroinvertebrate and fish sensitivity to deposited and suspended sediment.</p><p>Clapcott et al (2017) used gradient forest analysis to identify a % sediment cover threshold where specific macroinvertebrate species significantly changed in abundance (20 of the 23 taxa were also used in the Franklin et al 2019 community deviation analyses). Sediment cover thresholds ranged from 5 to 81 but averaged 21% fine sediment cover.</p><p>Wagenhoff et al (2017b) also used gradient forest analysis to explore the response of both periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities to turbidity and showed how periphyton communities change consistently from 1-25 NTU whereas there is greater macroinvertebrate turnover &lt;5NTU before relatively constant turnover up to 25 NTU. EPT taxa were most sensitive to turbidity.</p><p>Burdon et al (2013) identified 21% sediment cover as a changepoint in the relationship between a macroinvertebrate metric (%EPT) and in-stream deposited sediment across 30 agricultural streams; below 21% sediment cover a 55% increase in sediment cover resulted in 20% decrease in %EPT, there was no response to sediment cover above 21%. The 21% changepoint was close to the guideline value (20% cover) recommended by Clapcott et al (2011) informed from regression analysis (n = 128) and exploration of values observed at stream reference sites (n = 45) throughout New Zealand. Regression analysis showed MCI did not respond as steeply as %EPT and both were responsive to a full sediment gradient (0-100% cover). For %EPT, a 10% reduction was related to a 40% increase in sediment, and for MCI, a 2.75% reduction was related to an 80% increase in sediment.</p><p>Based on above analyses, any mitigation in sediment should result in the following ratios* of change:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Current state sediment</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Sediment mitigation</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Ecological mitigation</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;20% fine cover</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>50%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>20% EPT, 1.5% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&gt;20% fine cover</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>50%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>10% EPT, 1.5% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;5 NTU</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>20% O/E fish, 5% EPT, 1.5% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5-10 NTU</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15% O/E fish, 2.5% EPT, &lt;1% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&gt;10 NTU</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>10% O/E fish, &lt;1% EPT, &lt;1% MCI</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul><li><p>These are scalable ratios – for example, at &lt;20% fine cover a 30% sediment mitigation would lead to 12% change in %EPT, or a 70% sediment mitigation would lead to a 28% change in %EPT.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Nutrients</strong></p><p>Nutrients in streams directly affect aquatic plant growth, microbial activity, invertebrate and fish growth, and they mediate dissolved oxygen balance and greenhouse gas storage. Canning (2020) provided an in-depth exploration of the relationship between dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and other measures of ecosystem health (periphyton, macroinvertebrates, fish and ecosystem functioning) to derive national nutrient criteria. The multiple analyses provide a valuable resource that quantifies the relationship between DIN and aquatic life at the national scale. Relevant key points include:</p><ul><li><p>The relationship between DIN and periphyton (chl-a and biomass), macroinvertebrate metrics, and fish observed/expected scores is consistent across environment types.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Major changes in macroinvertebrate metrics are predicted to occur between 0.8-1.0 mg/L DIN and turnover in macroinvertebrate assemblages are predicted to occur between 0-1 mg/L DIN.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>5% of macroinvertebrate taxa experience substantial impacts on their probability of occurrence at 0.20 mg/L, 20% of taxa at 0.44 mg/L, 40% at 0.67 mg/L and 60% at 1.14 mg/L DIN.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Fish observed/expected scores decline until a plateau between 1-1.3 mg/L DIN before continuing to decline.</p></li></ul><p>There have been numerous other studies that have looked to quantify the relationship between nutrients and ecological repsonses at regional scales or using smaller datasets. For example, Graham et al (2018) found a negative relationship between nutrients and macroinvertebrate response in Taranaki strem subject to riparian restoration, which suggests that factors other than nutrients were more important in that context. The following information focuses on studeis which have identified measurable relationships between nutrients and ecological responses, and how these relationships miht change gradients of change rather than thresholds only.</p><p>Wagenhoff et al (2017a) explored the relationship between DIN and macroinvertebrate metrics, cyanobacterial cover and ecosystem processes in a regional dataset (n = 58) and showed relatively constant reponses between 0.1 and 0.8 mg/L DIN. In another analysis using gradient forest, Wagenhoff et al (2017b) identified 0.7 mg/L DIN as a threshold associated with declines in multiple macroinvertebrate taxa and suggested 0.3 mg/L DIN as a threshold to protect sensitive periphyton taxa.</p><p>Matheson et al (2012) explored the relationship between DIN and periphyton to review instream plant and nutrient guidelines. They showed a significant (R= 0.36, p &lt;0.05) yet noisy relationship between annual maximum cover of filamentous algae and DIN between 0-1 mg/L at 77 national gravel-bed river sites and recommended a threshold at 0.25 mg/L DIN. A Bayesian Belief Network, informed by multiple lines of evidence, suggested general nutrient states and associated probabilities of nuisance periphyton growths if all other factors are optimal (i.e. flushing flows, temperature) as follows: DIN &gt;0.3 mg/L = 100%; DIN 0.15-0.3 mg/L = 70%; DIN 0.05-0.15 mg/L = 50%; DIN &lt;0.05 mg/L = 30%.</p><p>Matheson et al (2016) also explored the relationship between DIN and periphyton chl-a (N = 871) and weighted composite cover (N = 1736). There was considerable fluctuation in regressions, but generally a 15% change in DIN (between 0.1 and 1 mg/L) resulted in an ~8% change in chlorophyll-a and a 15% change in DIN (between 0.03 and 0.36 mg/L) resulted in an ~4% change in weighted composite cover.</p><p>Snelder et al (2019) also explored the relationship between periphyton chlorophyll-a and TN at 77 gravel-bed river sites and showed it was consistent across environment types, except for the REC class CXM. Periphyton (filamentous) cover can be used to estimate chl-a concentration using the conversation factors of Kilroy et al (2013).</p><p>Based on above analyses, any mitigation in DIN should result in the following ratios of change:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Current state of DIN</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>DIN mitigation</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Ecological mitigation</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;1 mg/L</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;15%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;5% fil. periphyton cover, 1.5% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;1 mg/L</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15-50%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5-15% fil. periphyton cover, 3% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;1 mg/L</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&gt;50%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15-50% fil. periphyton cover, 6% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>≥1 mg/L</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;15%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;1% fil. periphyton cover, &lt;1% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>≥1 mg/L</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15-50%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5% fil. periphyton cover, 1.5% MCI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>≥1 mg/L</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&gt;50%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15% fil. periphyton cover, 3% MCI</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p><br/></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Shade and temperature</strong></p><p>Shade primarily affects streams by limiting light and temperature which in turn control primary and secondary productivity as well as other biogeochemical processes. Shade, when due to riparian vegetation, is also a useful indicator of habitat and food availability for aquatic fauna which determines macroinvertebrate and fish growth.</p><p>Shade is known to inhibit primary productivity. Using streamside channels, Quinn et al (1997) showed how algal biomass was limited to &lt;20 mg m<sup>-2</sup> chlorophyll-a when shade was 90%, &lt;30 mg m<sup>-2</sup> chlorophyll-a when shade was 60% (except for one bloom) and was &gt;50 mg m<sup>-2</sup> chlorophyll-a when shade was 0%. They also showed that macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness and total density also declined with increasing shade. Riparian shading was shown to mitigate stream eutrophication in 21 agricultural streams by Burrell et al (2014), with a 50% increase in shade (from 1 to 90% cover) associated with a 20% decrease in gross primary productivity (from 1 to 0.1 g O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup>/d).</p><p>Collins et al (2018) showed 80% shading (due to experimental weed mats) reduced macrophyte cover to 17% (and eliminated some species). However, Kankanamge et al (2019) showed that at high shade levels (&gt;90%) allowed non-native species to persist but growth rates were much reduced. The native charophyte <em>Nitella</em> aff. <em>cristata</em> was shade tolerant and performed best at higher shade. Further, Kankanamge et al (2020) showed how a 15% increase in shade (between 35 and 95% light reduction) led to a 20% reduction in exotic macrophyte biomass accrual. Mouton et al. (2019) found that riparian shading was a primary driver of macrophyte community composition in Waikato streams. Matheson et al. (2017) found that 65-70% shade was associated with periphyton weighted composite cover &lt;30% and macrophyte channel clogginess &lt;50% also, in Waikato streams. Collier et al. (1995) and Biggs (2000) also recommended 70% shade to control nuisance growth of periphyton.</p><p>The relationship between stream temperature and in-stream fauna was explored by Olsen et al (2011) and Davies-Colley et al (2013) to identify potential temperature criteria and thresholds for protecting in-stream values. Olsen et al (2011) identified the acute thermal criteria tolerance of 13 macroinvertebrates and 3 fish ranging from 21 to 32°C daily maximum, with behavioral and developmental effects observed at much lower temperatures. Davies-Colley et al (2013) recommended attribute bands from ≤ 18°C (A/B) through to 24°C (C/D) for Maritime regions and 19°C to 25°C for Dry Eastern regions, measured using the Cox-Rutherford Index (CRI; the average of daily mean and daily maxima during summer months). Their recommendations were based on optimum growth temperatures identified by Olsen et al (2011) as well as international temperature standards for streams. However, they also recommended temperature increments (relative to reference state) of 1°C (A/B) through to 3°C (C/D) to protect in-stream life from thermal stress, but note these recommendations are informed by a limited number of species. This makes it difficult to estimate change in stream ecology due to shade-induced temperature mitigation.</p><p>In a factorial experiment, Piggott et al (2012) demonstrated that temperature interacts with nutrients and sediment to affect periphyton, macroinvertebrates and biogeochemical processes; but main effects of a 1.4°C increase in temperature were algal proliferation and a decline in EPT abundance (no effect on overall macroinvertebrate community composition). Likewise, in a subsequent study, Piggott et al (2015) demonstrated that a 3°C increase in temperature significantly increases organic matter processing by 20% (i.e. 5% increase in temperature = 6% increase in microbial processing), but interaction with sediment and nutrients confound responses.</p><p>Based on the above analyses it is difficult to predict ecological response to mitigation in shade and temperature. However, the following could be used to inform interim expectations of the ratio* of change in ecological variables relative to shade/temperature mitigation:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/><col style="width: 226.67px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Current state shade/temperature</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Shade/temperature mitigation</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Ecological mitigation</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;70% shade</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>80%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>30% chl-a, 30% fil. periphyton cover</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>≥70 shade</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>30% chl-a, 30% fil. periphyton cover</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;15°C (CRI)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&lt;1% EPT</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15-25°C (CRI)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5% EPT</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>&gt;25°C (CRI)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5%</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>10% EPT</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul><li><p>These are scalable ratios – for example, at &lt;70% shade a 50% shade mitigation would lead to 19% change in %fil. periphyton cover, or a 20% shade mitigation would lead to a 7.5% change in %fil. periphyton cover.</p></li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><br/></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Measuring the ecological response to riparian mitigation of multiple drivers</strong></p><p>Riparian planting and fencing are assumed to mitigate the delivery of excess sediment, nutrients (direct and diffuse) and light into streams.
