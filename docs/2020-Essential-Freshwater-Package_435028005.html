                    <p>The 2020 “Essential Freshwater” package refers to a suite of rules and regulations released by the New Zealand government in September 2020. The package introduces new rules and regulations to:</p><ul><li><p>  stop further degradation of New Zealand’s freshwater resources and improve water quality within five years</p></li><li><p> reverse past damage and bring New Zealand’s freshwater resources, waterways and ecosystems to a healthy state within a generation<a href="#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Central to the Essential Freshwater package, the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (NPS-FM) sets Te Mana o Te Wai as guiding principle and establishes a hierarchy of obligations within its framework: to waterbodies first, then to the essential needs of people, and finally for other uses. The NPS-FM be given effect to as soon as reasonably practicable.</p><p>Te Mana o te Wai is a concept that refers to the fundamental importance of water and recognises that protecting the health of freshwater protects the health and well-being of the wider environment. It protects the mauri of the wai. Te Mana o te Wai is about restoring and preserving the balance between the water, the wider environment, and the community.</p><p>Policy 3.4 sets that</p><p>(1) Every local authority must actively involve tangata whenua (to the extent they wish to be involved) in freshwater management (including decision-making processes), including in all the following:</p><p>(a) identifying the local approach to giving effect to Te Mana o te Wai</p><p>(b) making or changing regional policy statements and regional and district plans so far as they relate to freshwater management</p><p>(c) implementing the NOF (see subclause (2))</p><p>(d) developing and implementing mātauranga Māori and other monitoring.</p><p>(2) In particular, and without limiting subclause (1), for the purpose of implementing the NOF, every regional council must work collaboratively with, and enable, tangata whenua to:</p><p>(a) identify any Māori freshwater values (in addition to mahinga kai) that apply to any FMU or part of an FMU in the region; and</p><p>(b) be actively involved (to the extent they wish to be involved) in decision-making processes relating to Māori freshwater values at each subsequent step of the NOF process.</p><p>The NPS-FM sets a National Objectives Framework (NOF), to ensure that the health and well-being of degraded water bodies and freshwater ecosystems is improved, and the health and well-being of all other water bodies and freshwater ecosystems is maintained and (if communities choose) improved. The NOF process requires regional councils to undertake the following steps:</p><p>(a) identify Freshwater Management Units (FMUs) in the region</p><p>(b) identify values for each FMU, which</p><p>§  must include the four compulsory Values of National Significance (Ecosystem Health, Human Contact, Threatened Species and Mahinga kai), and</p><p>§  may include other values, including the 9 Other National Values (defined in Appendix 1B of the NPS-FM);</p><p>(c) set environmental outcomes for each value and include them as objectives in regional plans</p><p>(d) identify attributes for each value and set baseline states for those attributes. All the attributes relevant to compulsory values must be used, and other attributes may be identified in relation to compulsory or other values. Any attribute must be specific and where practicable, assessed in numeric terms.</p><p>(e) set target attribute states, environmental flows and levels, and other criteria to support the achievement of environmental outcomes</p><p>(f) set limits as rules and prepare action plans (as appropriate) to achieve environmental outcomes</p><p> </p><p>The practical implementation of the NOF explicitly or implicitly sets out requirements that are of particular relevance to the Mitigation Effectiveness Monitoring Design project, in particular:</p><p>Appendix 1A provides a definition for each of the four compulsory values, as well as an indication of relevant attributes and matters to take into account in relation to each one of these values. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>The Ecosystem Health Value includes 5 biophysical components : water quality, water quantity, habitat, aquatic life and ecological processes</p></li><li><p>The Human Contact Value is defined as including pathogens, water clarity, deposited sediment, plant growth, cyanobacteria, other toxicants and litter.</p></li><li><p>The Threatened species value requires that all the components of ecosystem health must be managed, as well as (if appropriate) specialised habitat or conditions needed for only part of the life cycle of the threatened species</p></li><li><p>The Mahinga Kai value refers to kai being safe to harvest and eat. It generally refers to the freshwater species that have traditionally been used as food, tools, or other resources. It also refers to the places those species are found and to the act of catching or harvesting them</p></li></ul><p>Appendix 2 of the NPS-FM sets out freshwater attributes relating to compulsory values requiring either the setting of limits on resource use (Appendix 2A) or action plans (Appendix 2B). In addition, Clause 3.13 requires that DRP and DIN criteria be set in many situations.</p><p>Policy 3.18 sets the following monitoring requirements with regards to progress towards achieving environmental outcomes:</p><p><em>(1) Every regional council must establish methods for monitoring progress towards achieving target attributes states and environmental outcomes.</em></p><p><em>(2) The methods must include measures of:</em></p><p><em>(a) mātauranga Māori; and</em></p><p><em>(b) the health of indigenous flora and fauna.</em></p><p><em>(3) Monitoring methods must recognise the importance of long-term trends, and the relationship between results and their contribution to evaluating progress towards achieving long-term visions and environmental outcomes for FMUs and parts of FMUs.</em></p><p> </p><p>Policy 3.19 specifically addresses how temporal trends in attribute states (whether improving or deteriorating) must be assessed, including the need to determine appropriate assessment periods and sampling frequency and distribution. It also sets clear requirements to investigate the cause of any deteriorating trend.</p><p>Policy 3.20 sets that a regional council must respond to a degraded or degrading FMU, for example by preparing an action plan. Any action plans must include actions to identify the causes of the deterioration, methods to address those causes, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the methods.</p><p> </p><p>In summary, the NPS-FM sets out a range of requirements that directly relate to this project:</p><ul><li><p>The NOF and associated appendices, as well as specific clauses of the NPS-FM define a wide range of attributes and how they relate to the values. These Attributes, Values and relationships were included in the Monitoring Design Framework as described in Section 4.3.1;</p></li><li><p>The NPS-FM places particular emphasis on Tangata whenua involvement in freshwater management, including implementing the NOF, identifying Mahinga Kai and other Maori freshwater values and developing and implementing mātauranga Māori monitoring</p></li><li><p>The NPS-FM places significant emphasis on the assessment of temporal trends, with specific requirements to ensure that sampling programmes are appropriate to assess trends. These aspects are considered in the Statistical Analysis Module described in Section 4.3.3</p></li><li><p>Various policies require the development of monitoring and action plans, to characterise the state of the freshwater resource and respond to degraded or degrading freshwater, with a common requirement to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of policies, rules and methods (including action plans) and progress towards environmental outcomes. These considerations are at the heart of the Mitigation Effectiveness Monitoring Framework described in Section 4 below.</p></li></ul><p> </p><p><br/></p><hr/><p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a class="external-link" href="https://www.mfe.govt.nz/essential-freshwater-new-rules-and-regulations" rel="nofollow">https://www.mfe.govt.nz/essential-freshwater-new-rules-and-regulations</a>T</p><p />
