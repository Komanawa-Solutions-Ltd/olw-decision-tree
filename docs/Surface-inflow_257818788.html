                    <p>Nutrient input (loading) from streams entering the lake may be measured based on monitoring of stream concentrations and flow rates. Loadings can either be directly monitored or modeled.  </p><p>Monitoring usually entails setting up flow monitoring stations to capture the variation of flow over time and determining nutrient concentrations in stream samples. Loadings can then be calculated using temporal interpolation and rating curves (see Snelder 2014). Statistical methods can then be employed to estimate the uncertainties in loads. For lakes, a key source of uncertainty is the fact that not all tributaries can monitored on the ground. Missing tributaries can either be extrapolated in homogenous catchments, or measurements can be substituted by catchment models.</p><p>The simplest type of model is based on export coefficients, whereby the area of each land use (assessed from spatial analysis) is multiplied by an export coefficient (an estimated average load per unit area attributable to a land cover, land use, slope, climate, etc.) and summed over the different land uses for the full lake catchment. Source coefficients for pastoral catchments can for example be estimated from the farm-scale OVERSEER Nutrient Budget model (Selbie et al. 2013) which is used widely in New Zealand. The catchment nutrient export model CLUES (Catchment Land Use Environmental Sustainability) can be used to estimate the flux of nutrients in New Zealand streams under different land uses (Woods et al. 2006a). </p><p>A range of more sophisticated dynamic, process models is also available for assessing external loadings to lakes. These offer the prospect of decomposing loads over time and into different nutrient fractions, but entail considerable effort to set up and run. Generally, the uncertainties of the model outputs are not well characterised in these models and so they should be used with caution in setting nutrient load limits. <br/><br/>Snelder T, Rajanayaka C, Fraser C (2014) Contaminant load calculator.
