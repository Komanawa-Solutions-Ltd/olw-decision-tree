                    <h2 id="Recommendationsforfurtherwork-1.1Improvementstotheexistingframeworkcomponents">1.1        Improvements to the existing framework components</h2><p>Recommendations and suggestions for further work are identified throughout the various elements and modules for the possible future development of specific elements of the framework beyond the “proof of concept” stage. For convenience, these are summarised below.</p><ol><li><p><u>Definition and integration of mitigation actions</u>:</p></li></ol><p>a.        further consideration is required on how mitigation plans and mitigation actions may be integrated within the Farm Environmental Plan process, as well as situations where this integration may not be possible or desirable.</p><p>b.       Further work to the link the methods and outputs Land Management Actions Register (LMAR) project as inputs to this Monitoring Design Framework, potentially further developed using a farm typology approach</p><p> </p><p><u>2. Range of mitigation actions</u>: The following mitigation actions were not covered in this phase of the project, and would require further work:</p><p>a.       In-river mitigation actions, such as bank erosion control measures, in-stream habitat restoration, etc.</p><p>b.       erosion control measures, such as spaced planting, marginal land retirement, etc.</p><p>c.       Mitigation actions taken within commercial forestry plantations to reduce adverse effects during and following harvest.</p><p> </p><p><u>3. Statistical analysis module</u>: Further work is recommended to:</p><p>a.       Develop further guidance to relative to events-based and continuous monitoring, with a particular focus on how these may affect change detection (including likelihood and time required);</p><p>b.       Develop more detailed guidance on monitoring network design approaches and how they may be used in the context of this monitoring design framework.</p><p> </p><p><u>4. Load Estimation module</u>: Should this module be fully developed, further guidance should be included on groundwater and fluvial load estimation methods.</p><p> </p><p><u>5. Mātauranga Māori: The following potential further work/ projects were identified:</u></p><p>a.       The monitoring design and technologies frameworks currently do not define <u>who</u> should undertake the monitoring . The fundamental importance of whakapapa and the need for mana whenua to undertake monitoring within their rohe, using tools they feel comfortable with, was highlighted.</p><p>b.       The sensitive nature of some of the information forming part of kaupapa Māori assessment frameworks (e.g. Wāhi Tapu) means that matters of confidentiality and access to the data must be considered further;</p><p>c.       Further expand and test the potential for the Monitoring Design Framework to incorporate a both kaupapa Māori and biophysical attributes and measures;</p><p>d.       Identify one or several catchments and mitigation plans where the expanded framework could be tested. The Tahurehu River catchment, a tributary of the Waipaoa River near Gisborne has been identified as a potential test catchment.</p><p>e.       Explore the potential to include mahinga kai/ mātauranga Māori monitoring requirements in Farm Environmental Plans. The Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere catchment, in Canterbury, has been identified as a potential case study</p><p> </p><p><u>6. Riparian DST</u>: The following further work was identified by the working group, to bring the Riparian DST from its current “proof of concept” level of development to a user-ready tool:</p><p>a.       Further refine shade and water temperature prediction capabilities</p><p>b.       Extend to include nutrient prediction</p><p>c.       Extend to quantitatively predict ecological responses from water quality responses taking into account current state</p><p>d.       Acquire real data on landscape and response parameters for one or more test catchments, validate results</p><p>e.       Develop a user interface for the tool including links to (or creation of) national datasets/layers for landscape and response parameters</p><p> </p><p><u>7. Lakes DST</u>: The lake DST would benefit from the following additional work:</p><p>a.       Expand the DST to cover all New Zealand lake types,</p><p>b.       Expand the DST to cover additional mitigations/interventions and freshwater attributes,</p><p>c.       Integrate further analysis of how various monitoring technologies may impact on monitoring design and frequency and thus on statistical detection of change</p><p>d.       Integrate further analysis and consideration of the implications of very low concentrations (e.g. of nutrients in oligotrophic lakes) and changes in laboratory methods on long-term detection of trends/ changes.</p><p> </p><p><u>8. Groundwater nitrate DST</u>: The following actions are recommended:</p><p>a.       Further development of the Confluence site as a mitigation monitoring design information and toolkit hub</p><p>b.       A full literature review of scientific methods for groundwater monitoring design;</p><p>c.       Improvement of the FCI methodology through development of an automated inversion process to determine the range of historic catchment N loads and age distributions that are consistent with the measured data.</p><p>d.       Method testing on a range of catchments and receptors (lakes, wells, streams and rivers) and at a variety of scales</p><p>e.       Deployment of easy to use tools and guidance for statistical power analysis, with worked examples for some New Zealand catchments</p><p>f.        Research into the spatial and temporal variability in groundwater nitrate concentrations and spatial variability in loss reductions due to land use mitigations</p><p>g.       Guidance on delineation of recharge/catchment areas for wells and groundwater-fed water bodies, drawing on recent and currently ongoing research in this field</p><p>h.       Evaluation of the potential for inclusion of soil/vadose zone nitrate monitoring within the DST suite.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 id="Recommendationsforfurtherwork-Tooldevelopmentandintegration">Tool development and integration</h2><p>In addition, the working group makes the following suggestions to facilitate further tool development and integration with other programmes of work:</p><p /><p><u>9. Catering for a range of end-users:</u> The Advisory Group identified Regional Councils, Iwi, and multi-agency catchment groups as the key potential end-users for this “proof of concept” phase. A reasonably high level of end user technical proficiency was assumed for the initial development of the project. Consultation with potential end-users has indicated that a “simplified” module may be useful to enable access by a wider range of users, including in particular community groups;</p><p>10.   <u>End-user interface</u>. Feedback from regional councils has indicated interest in an interface-based tool to enable direct use in specific projects. This is particularly the case in the context of non-regulatory mitigation projects initiated by catchment or community groups, where users could directly input the anticipated mitigation actions (in particular riparian management) and produce colour-coded maps to guide the development of a monitoring plan;</p><p>11.   <u>Extending the framework to urban and/or estuarine environments</u>. This phase of the project specifically excluded urban and estuarine/coastal environment. Stakeholder engagement has highlighted significant interest in extending the framework to cover these environments;</p><p>12.   <u>Mātauranga Māori monitoring: </u>Further development of a mātauranga Māori-based monitoring framework, integration with the framework developed during this “proof of concept” phase and application to case studies;</p><p>13.   <u>Integration with FEPs</u>: Further consideration of integration of monitoring, including mātauranga Māori / mahinga kai monitoring into the Farm Environmental Plan (FEP) process;</p><p>14.   <u>Integration with catchment/lake Modelling</u>: Given the long-term, sometimes multi-generational, nature of freshwater ecosystem restoration, and the limitations and uncertainties associated with environmental monitoring it is sometimes desirable to rely on a combination of modelling and actual monitoring data to evaluate the achievement or progress towards, a given environmental outcome. On this basis, further consideration should be given to how this monitoring design framework may be used to develop monitoring plans to support the development, calibration and validation of catchment and/or lake models.</p><p>15.   <u>Integration with Monitoring Technologies</u>: Further integration with the work produced by the Technology working group, including:</p><p>a.       guidance on how the introduction of different monitoring technologies, protocols and frequency/timing (e.g. continuous or event-based monitoring) may influence change detection power;</p><p>b.       Integration of monitoring costs to facilitate cost/benefit analysis of monitoring network options (including a comparison with modelling costs where monitoring costs may prove prohibitive);</p><p>c.       Integration of monitoring technology, change detection, and costs into an optimisation routine to minimize costs whilst optimising the likelihood of detection change within the timeframe sought.</p>
