                    <p>Nitrate concentrations in the Kaiapoi River are increasing and hence monitoring duration requirements should be evaluated with the FCI tool.</p><p>Figure 1 presents an example of the FCI method implementation. Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 are the upper and lower bound counterfactual nitrate concentration time series (i.e. assuming no mitigation); Scenario 3 and 4 are the upper and lower bound factuals for a 15% and a 30% catchment N load reduction respectively.</p><p>Results show that under Scenario 3 (15% catchment N load reduction) the projected future nitrate concentrations fall within the possible range that could occur in the absence of mitigation (i.e. within the counterfactual envelope). It would therefore not be possible to determine the effectiveness of the mitigation with a sufficient degree of certainty. Under Scenario 4 the projected future nitrate concentrations fall outside of the possible range that could occur without mitigation. Whilst it would not be clear in this example whether the mitigation had reduced nitrate concentrations in 2025 by 1.3 mg/L (from 6.2 to 4.9 mg/L for Scenario 1 minus Scenario 4) or by 0.6 mg/L (from 5.4 to 4.9 mg/L for Scenario 2 minus Scenario 4), the nitrate reduction associated with the mitigation actions would be identifiable in the measured data. It could therefore be concluded that an alternative monitoring location, most likely closer to the nitrate load mitigation area, would be required to evaluate mitigation effectiveness under a 15% catchment N load reduction. Monitoring at this site would be a viable option under the 30% N load mitigation scenario, but the degree to which the mitigation had been effective would be somewhat uncertain. Alternative monitoring sites would be required to resolve this uncertainty.</p><p>Note that the upper and lower bounds were derived from approximate visual matching to the measurement-based stream N loads, for illustrative purposes. A methodology improvement recommendation is provided in Section 4.7.8. </p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="680" loading="lazy" src="attachments/479396056/481689605.png?width=680" data-image-src="attachments/479396056/481689605.png" data-height="308" data-width="425" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="481689605" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="FCI nitrate time series data.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="479396056" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" data-media-id="5d409b7b-ba2f-444c-9ec8-5279e250096d" data-media-type="file"></span><p><strong>Figure 1</strong>              <strong>FCI nitrate time series data</strong></p>
