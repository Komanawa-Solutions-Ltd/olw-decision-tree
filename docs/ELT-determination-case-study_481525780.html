                    <p>The mitigation monitoring design decision support process outlined in the previous sections is applied to an example catchment (the Waimakariri management zone in Canterbury) to illustrate concepts and their implementation in more detail. Two of the main watercourses in the catchment, Kaiapoi River and Cust Main Drain, were selected for analysis. Private water supply wells are also consider towards the end of the case study.</p><p>Environment Canterbury has proposed a change to the Land and Water Regional Plan (LWRP) to reduce nitrate discharges to water bodies within the zone. The notified plan proposes:</p><ol><li><p>A 15% N loss reduction from dairy farms and 5% for all other consented land uses by 2030.</p></li><li><p>Continued N loss reductions if monitoring and science work undertaken for a proposed 2032 plan change shows nitrate concentrations still exceed or are likely to exceed the target values.</p></li></ol><p>A science update and progress review is sought by community in 2025 to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigations implemented by that time, to evaluate likely future nitrate concentrations and to assess the need (or otherwise) for ongoing nitrogen loss reductions. This information is of significant importance for farm planning and investment decision-making. Determination of the monitoring period required to assess mitigation efficacy is therefore of great value for the community, local stakeholders and the regional council.</p><p><em><strong>Step 1: ELT Analysis</strong></em></p><p>Age tracer testing (tritium) of samples collected from the Kaiapoi River and Cust Main Drain monitoring sites in 2016 under baseflow conditions gave a mean residence times (MRTs) of 5 - 7 years and 8 – 10 years respectively (van der Raaij, 2016).</p><p>The aquifer is conceptualised as a dual porosity system with relatively fast flow through buried river channel deposits (open framework gravels), near surface deposits and the land area proximal to the stream. Flow through the fine-grained alluvial sediment matrix, which encapsulate the river channel deposits, and through the deeper aquifer system is much slower. A binary exponential piston flow model has therefore been used to hypothesise a range of age distributions for the water sample. Two possible cumulative age distributions for five and seven year MRTs (i.e. the Kaiapoi River site) are plotted in Figure 1. The data give an ELT range of 10 – 18 years for the Kaiapoi River site; an equivalent analysis for the Cust Main Drain site gives an ELT of 16 – 27 years.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" width="618" loading="lazy" src="attachments/481525780/481525833.png?width=618" data-image-src="attachments/481525780/481525833.png" data-height="476" data-width="657" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="481525833" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Cumulative distribution of water age for Kaiapoi River site.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="481525780" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" data-media-id="2e62b240-72f5-488b-aacc-8b4142a32d42" data-media-type="file"></span><p><strong>Figure 1   Cumulative distribution of water age for Kaiapoi River site</strong></p><p />
