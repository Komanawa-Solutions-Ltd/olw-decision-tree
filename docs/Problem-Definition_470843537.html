                    <p>At heart, the mitigation effectiveness monitoring design framework needs to answer the following question </p><p>“Have the mitigation actions resulted in improved freshwater outcomes?”</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li><p>“mitigation actions” are taken in a broad sense, and may include changes in farming/ land use practices, actions taken at the “edge of field” (such as constructed wetlands, bunds and trenches), at the land/water interface (such as riparian restoration), or directly in the waterbody (such as stream habitat restoration and in-lake interventions);</p></li><li><p>“mitigation or restoration plan” means a set of mitigation actions taken with the objective of improving one or several freshwater outcomes;</p></li><li><p>“Freshwater outcomes” has a meaning similar to that of the Freshwater Values as defined in the NPS-FM.</p></li></ul><p>The review of available literature indicated that freshwater mitigation/restoration plans often did not include dedicated monitoring of freshwater outcomes. The general tendency seems to rely on pre-existing monitoring networks, such as “state of the environment” monitoring programmes. Whilst these programmes often present the advantage of providing long-term datasets, they are, by nature, not designed to measure the effectiveness of a specific intervention or mitigation plan. As a result, they are often ill-suited to the early detection of change or the establishment of a cause to effect relationship (has the change been caused by the intervention?).</p><p /><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="680" loading="lazy" src="attachments/470843537/471040189.png?width=680" data-image-src="attachments/470843537/471040189.png" data-height="205" data-width="547" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="471040189" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20210328-054951.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="470843537" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="23764b51-e63a-43cb-91ce-132d07a929bd" data-media-type="file"></span><p /><p>The above question is posed within a typical pressure/response/evaluation cycle, illustrated in a simplistic way in Figure 2. When a response (a mitigation plan) is formulated to address a pressure or an issue (degraded freshwater resource), monitoring the outcomes enables an evaluation of the effectiveness of the response. Understanding successes and failures, and their reasons, is a necessary part of the cycle leading to greater confidence about the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of various mitigation actions in a range of contexts and the formulation and uptake of more effective mitigation plans. </p><p>In the specific context of the three work streams, Te Mana o Te Wai forms the overarching principle guiding freshwater management and feeds into every step of the cycle. The Monitoring Design project (this project) aims at defining what should be measured, where and when, whilst the Monitoring Technology project provides guidance on monitoring technologies available, their level of readiness and their indicative cost.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="680" loading="lazy" src="attachments/470843537/471040199.png?width=680" data-image-src="attachments/470843537/471040199.png" data-height="363" data-width="559" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="471040199" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20210328-055050.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="470843537" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="67b35fbd-49f5-4fb9-be47-cb747969d3b0" data-media-type="file"></span><p /><p /><p />
