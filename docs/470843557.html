                    <p>The various elements of the Monitoring Design Framework are conceptually represented in Figure 3.  The key inputs, elements and outputs of the framework are as follows:</p><ol><li><p /></li></ol><p><u>Inputs</u></p><p>a.    <u>Mitigation actions</u>: What mitigation actions will be /have been undertaken, where and when, is information that is assumed to be an input into the framework.</p><p>b.    <u>Catchment/waterbody characteristics</u>: Available information on the subject catchment and waterbody is also considered an input into the framework. This includes for example lake/ stream /aquifer types, contaminant pathways, lag/ transport/ response times, climate, geology, as well as existing water quality and ecology data.</p><p>c.     <u>Freshwater values/outcomes</u> for the catchment or area of interest. Setting freshwater values or objectives falls outside the scope of this project and is assumed to be known by the user (e.g. outcomes of consultation processes, regional plans, etc.), and is thus treated as input information into the framework.</p><ol><li><p /></li></ol><p><u>Decision Support Tools </u><a href="#_msocom_1" rel="nofollow">[ze1]</a> <u> </u>The Monitoring Design Framework involves a range of tools and resources to support the design of a monitoring plan, including:</p><p>a.    <u>Expected Benefits of mitigation action</u>: Tools and resources to qualify and quantify the expected benefits of the proposed mitigation plan, i.e. what freshwater attributes may be directly or indirectly influenced by the mitigation, by how much and where.</p><p>b.    <u>Detecting change</u>: a range of statistical tools and methods to assess the likelihood of detecting change in freshwater attributes, including where and when change may be detected, depending on sampling frequency.</p><ol><li><p /></li></ol><p><u>Output: Monitoring Plan: </u>The final output of the framework is a monitoring plan, including what to monitor, where and when.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p /><p>Figure 7: Key elements of the Mitigation Effectiveness Monitoring Design Framework.</p><p> </p><p>The Mitigation Effectiveness Monitoring Design Framework provides information, resources and guidance on how above inputs can be considered, analysed and integrated, forming the basis for the formulation of a monitoring plan. The process follows five key steps leading to the formulation of a 3-tier monitoring plan, detailed below.</p><p> </p><h3 id="OverallApproach:five-stepprocess-1.1.1Step1:Definethemonitoringpurpose">1.1.1        Step 1: Define the monitoring purpose</h3><p>The first step in the process is to define the purpose of the monitoring plan – in essence what question(s) will the monitoring plan need to address. Clearly identifying and articulating these questions is a critical step in the process, as they will guide the development of the monitoring plan.</p><p>Generally, a mitigation plan will have a stated objective or objectives, which should constitute the starting point. Current mitigation plans in New Zealand include a range of objectives, formulated more or less specifically, for example:</p><p>·         The stated objective may be relatively general, and not quantifiable or time bound, e.g. improve ecological health or mahinga kai values in a sub-catchment;</p><p>·         The stated objective may be quantified, either explicitly (e.g. achieve a Trophic Lake Index of X) or by reference to a standard or guideline (e.g. achieve the NPS-FM national bottom line for a given Attribute);</p><p>·         The stated objective may also be quantified, spatially explicit and time bound. For example:</p><p>§  Achieve swimmability national bottom line at a specified site by 2030; or</p><p>§  Reduce sediment load delivery to a harbour by 50% by 2050.</p><p> </p><p>Defining the monitoring purpose(s) will inevitably provide direct guidance as to what should be monitored and where.</p><p>For example, if the mitigation plan’s main objective is to reduce nitrate concentration below a certain level at a given location, then (obviously), the monitoring plan will need to include nitrate monitoring at that location (or a representative location). </p><p>The way the mitigation objectives are expressed may place additional constraints on the monitoring methods and frequency. For example, most NPS-FM Attributes are expressed in a relatively directive way, generally including sampling frequency and duration, and sometimes sampling protocol, in order to establish an Attribute State grading for the site.</p><p>Importantly, restoration of freshwater values is often a long-term, sometimes multi-generational, aspiration, due to a combination of natural processes (e.g. contaminant transport processes, ecological response times), monitoring/statistical constraints (e.g. time required to detect a change once it has happened) and the social and economic factors associated with the implementation of a mitigation plan (e.g. time given to farmers to implement change). Management or mitigation plans often acknowledge the long timescales involved, and sometimes set intermediary targets. In these circumstances, early detection of improvement and the ability to report on progress/direction of travel becomes critical.</p><p> </p><p>At a national scale, both the long timescales required to achieve a healthy state of the resource and the desire to detect a measurable improvement quickly are recognised in the stated objective of the recent Essential Freshwater package:</p><p>·         “stop further degradation of New Zealand’s freshwater resources and improve water quality within five years</p><p>·         reverse past damage and bring New Zealand’s freshwater resources, waterways and ecosystems to a healthy state within a generation”</p><p> </p><h3 id="OverallApproach:five-stepprocess-1.1.2Step2:Catchmentvaluesandnaturalcharacteristics">1.1.2        Step 2: Catchment values and natural characteristics</h3><p>The third step in the process is to understand the catchment’s characteristics and how they might affect mitigation effectiveness, or our ability to measure change.  In essence this is about assembling data and information to build a “state of knowledge” picture of the catchment or waterbody, including what is known about:</p><p>·         Lake river and/or aquifer type</p><p>·         Freshwater values associated with the waterbody, including where they apply</p><p>·         State and trends of water quality and ecological indicators</p><p>·         Catchment processes, contaminant pathways and transport/lag times</p><p>Through this step, the following should be identified:</p><p>·         Attributes, indicators and measures</p><p>·         Locations of interest (e.g. where a specific value applies, such as a mahinga kai site)</p><p>·         Where possible, an indication of potential lag/transport and response times</p><p>The following resources provide guidance through this step:</p><p>·         A table identifying the linkages between freshwater Values and Attributes (refer to Section 4.4.1 for more detail);</p><p>·         Guidance on lake types and relevant Interventions and freshwater Attributes in the Lakes Mitigation DST<a href="#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (Section 4.5);</p><p>·         Guidance regarding estimating groundwater lag time<a href="#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in the Groundwater DST (Section 4.7.2).</p><h3 id="OverallApproach:five-stepprocess-1.1.3Step3:Characteriseandquantifypotentialeffectsofmitigation">1.1.3        Step 3: Characterise and quantify potential effects of mitigation</h3><p>The second step in the process is to characterise the mitigation actions/interventions and estimate their potential benefits, as follows:</p><p>·         Establish (e.g. from the mitigation plan) what mitigation action, or group of actions, will be (or have been), and where;</p><p>·         Understand the mitigation action’s mode of operation, i.e. what it is meant to do and when. In some circumstances it is advisable to verify that the intervention has worked as expected.</p><p>§  For example, it is advisable to undertake monitoring of water column suspended solids/ turbidity in the hours/days following the application of a phosphorus inactivation agent.</p><p>·         Establish what freshwater indicators /attributes may be influenced by the mitigation action and when (establishment time).</p><p>§  For example: Riparian vegetation may require 5-15 years to influence stream bed shading and water temperature  </p><p>·         Taking into account the local context (e.g. stream type/width, land slope, soil type), Quantify the potential benefits of the mitigation action(s) <u>at the local scale;</u></p><p>·         Aggregate the above information to establish the potential benefits of the mitigation plan as a whole <u>at the appropriate measurement scale (e.g. catchment, zone, supply well recharge area).</u></p><p>The level of detail required to undertake this step depends on the mitigation plan and particularly whether mitigation actions need to be considered individually or if they are “packaged” together at the property scale as part of a Farm Environmental Plan (FEP).</p><p>Farm Environmental Plans (FEPs)are currently required in many regions in New Zealand, particularly for intensive land use, and the Essential Freshwater Package strengthens these requirements. Regional plans often require FEPs to demonstrate achievement of specified performance targets, such as a given reduction in contaminant losses from the property. As such, FEPs have become a key policy implementation tool by which contaminant emissions from a property are managed. In this context, individual mitigation actions are formulated as part of a “toolbox” of options available to achieve the contaminant loss reduction targets.</p><p>Wherever practicable, the intent for this monitoring design framework is to use the information contained in FEPs as an input into the monitoring design framework. For example, the groundwater DST case study uses the nitrogen loss reduction targets set by the Waimakariri Plan Change 7C as input (Refer to Section 4.7.3).</p><p>However, there were two circumstances where mitigation actions were considered individually (and not as part of a FEP):</p><p>·         In-lake interventions are not generally part of an FEP process, and were thus considered individually in the Lake Monitoring DST (Section 4.6 of this report);</p><p>·         Riparian buffers are often implemented outside of farm planning processes as part of non-regulatory processes, e.g. by catchment community groups. In addition, relevant information relative to the effectiveness of riparian buffers has recently been compiled (McKergow, 2020). This information was used as the basis for the Riparian DST (section 4.5 of this report)</p><p> </p><p>The following resources have been developed to guide the user through this step:</p><p>·         A database (currently contained in a series of excel spreadsheets) compiling information on the potential effectiveness of mitigation actions on contaminant losses from land and stream habitat characteristics, as well as the expected establishment and effective lifespan of the mitigation. Whilst a range of on-farm and edge-of field mitigation actions were considered, this database was fully populated for riparian buffers only for the “proof of concept” phase of the project.</p><p>·         A methodology to estimate a “Riparian Buffer Effectiveness Index” to estimate the potential benefits of riparian buffers on contaminant losses, shade and water temperature;</p><p>·         A compilation of information relative to the mode of action and potential effectiveness of in-lake interventions.</p><h3 id="OverallApproach:five-stepprocess-1.1.4Step4:Detectingchange">1.1.4        Step 4: Detecting change</h3><p>The fourth step in the process is to determine, based on the information and analysis gathered as part of the first three steps, the likelihood of detecting a change, and the time required to detect it, in freshwater attributes and indicators at various places in the waterbody and/or catchment.</p><p>The Monitoring Design Framework uses various versions of power analyses to detect effect size and temporal trends, as described in the Statistical Analysis Module<a href="#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (Section 4.4.3). Power analyses can be used for range of purposes, including:</p><p>·         Test the ability of the <u>existing</u> monitoring network to detect the potential changes brought by the mitigation plan (what is the likelihood of detecting a change within, say 5 years, on the basis of existing monitoring locations and sampling frequencies?). From this, a gap analysis can be conducted to identify situations and locations where the existing monitoring network has a very small chance of detecting the potential change changes and needs to be supplemented by additional/alternative monitoring;</p><p>·         Determine locations where the likelihood of detecting a change within a given time period is highest in the catchment;</p><p>·         Test whether increasing sampling frequency, or changing the sampling regime, is likely to increase the change detection power.</p><p>The Riparian and Groundwater Nitrate DSTs provide worked examples of these questions in the context of test catchments/ scenarios. In the future it is anticipated that this analysis can be built into an interface as a series of user defined questions.</p><p>The following resources provide guidance through this step:</p><p>·         A Statistical Analysis module, described in Section 4.4.3;</p><p>·         A Forward Counterfactual Inference (CFI) module, described in Section 4.7.2</p><p>·         Worked examples, in the context of:</p><p>§  A riparian buffer mitigation plan<a href="#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and</p><p>§  Farm interventions aiming at reducing nitrate concentrations in groundwater and spring-fed stream (add ref)</p><p> </p><h3 id="OverallApproach:five-stepprocess-1.1.5Step5:MonitoringPlan">1.1.5        Step 5: Monitoring Plan</h3><p>The last step of the process is to assemble the information and analysis undertaken as part of the first four steps to develop a monitoring plan. The monitoring design framework proposes a general 3-tier structure for mitigation effectiveness monitoring plans:</p><p><u>Tier 1: Monitoring and Detecting Early Response</u>.</p><p>This component of the monitoring plan focuses on:</p><p>·         verifying that the mitigation action has worked as expected.</p><p>§  For example, monitoring of water column suspended solids/ turbidity in the hours/days following the application of a phosphorus inactivation agent;</p><p>·         Monitoring early indicators of success, by focussing the monitoring on locations and freshwater attributes or indicator that are the most likely to show a fast response.</p><p>·         This tier of monitoring may focus on locations and indicators most likely to show a response within 5 years, and thus be used to assess success and/or progress against the Essential Freshwater package’s short term objective: “stop<em> further degradation of New Zealand’s freshwater resources and improve water quality within five years</em>”</p><p>·         Tier 1 monitoring may be undertaken at locations which are somewhat remote from the location where the mitigation plan’s outcome(s) have been set, or measure indicators that are known drivers (as opposed to a direct measure of) the mitigation plan’s outcomes.</p><p>·         For example:</p><p>§  Nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater close to where the on-farm nutrient mitigation measures are implemented is likely to show a faster response than a spring-fed stream located further downgradient;</p><p>§  Measuring a response in ecological measures (e.g. periphyton abundance or macroinvertebrate communities) may require a long period of time. Known drivers of ecological health, such as habitat, deposited sediment, nutrient concentrations or shade may provide an earlier indication of a likely direction of travel.</p><p> </p><p><u>Tier2: Monitoring Freshwater outcomes</u></p><p>This component of the monitoring plan focuses on medium to long-term monitoring of the mitigation plans freshwater outcomes. Depending on the time scale involved, monitoring should focus on:</p><p>·         Monitoring whether the mitigation plan’s objectives have been met at the locations and to the extent specified in the mitigation plan.</p><p>·         This tier of monitoring may be used to assess success against, or progress towards, the Essential Freshwater package’s long-term objective: “<em>reverse past damage and bring New Zealand’s freshwater resources, waterways and ecosystems to a healthy state within a generation”.</em></p><p>·         Monitoring to estimate the direction and magnitude of change to evaluate whether the mitigation plan is “on track” to achieve long-term objectives, and if not, to adjust the mitigation plan.</p><p>§  For example, the Waimakariri Plan Change 7 sets long-term objectives as nitrate concentrations at given sites, and several cycles of on-farm mitigation followed by monitoring and evaluation and, if required, further requirements to reduce nitrogen losses from farms.</p><p> </p><p><u>Tier 3: Mitigation longevity and sustainability</u></p><p>This component of the monitoring plan focuses on medium to long-term monitoring of the longevity and sustainability of the mitigation plan, including:</p><p>·         Monitoring the longevity of those mitigation actions that are expected to have a limited lifespan (e.g. constructed wetlands, sediment retention bunds),</p><p>·         Evaluating if an intervention may need to be repeated periodically, and how often</p><p>§  For example, in-lake interventions such as application of a phosphorus inactivation agent or weed harvesting may need to be repeated periodically as nutrient inputs from the catchment replenish the in-lake available nutrient loads. Monitoring incoming contaminant loads from surface and groundwater inputs (and atmospheric deposition) will help determine how often the intervention will need to be repeated.</p><p>·         Monitoring whether the freshwater outcomes achieved by the mitigation plan are maintained in the long-term</p><p>·         Monitoring risks or potential side-effects of the mitigation actions</p><p>§  For example, metal accumulation in lake sediment may need to be monitored following application of metal-based phosphorus inactivation agent.</p><p> </p><p>In all tiers of the monitoring plan, the spatial and temporal elements of the mitigation plan and monitoring purpose will also guide the monitoring network design approach. For example:</p><p>·         In situations where a monitoring plan is formulated and able to be implemented <u>before</u> the mitigation actions are implemented, or where n<del>l</del>o mitigations are implemented, a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design may be used, where data are collected at or below the mitigated site and a control site before and after the mitigation is applied.</p><p>·         Where the mitigation purpose is to improve an attribute overall within a given spatial unit (e.g. catchment-wide mitigation to improve ecological health), catchment-scale monitoring networks may be designed using a range of approaches, including randomised locations, sites stratified proportionally within environmental or geographic classes or optimised to reduce redundancy within the network.</p><p> </p><p>The following resources provide guidance through this step:</p><p>·         Monitoring network design guidance</p><p>·         A contaminant load estimation module (see section 4.3.4)</p><p>·         Monitoring guidance for combinations of 6 lake types, 6 interventions and 7 attributes (see lakes DST, Section 4.5);</p><p>·         Scenarios/ case studies, in the context of:</p><p>§  A riparian buffer mitigation plan<a href="#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> to reduce sediment loads and improve ecological health;</p><p>§  A waterway improvement in a coastal estuary to improve mahinga kai [add ref]</p><p>§  Farm interventions aiming at reducing nitrate concentrations in groundwater and spring-fed stream (see Section 4.6)</p><p><br/></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="Lake-monitoring-DST_119996429.html" data-linked-resource-id="119996429" data-linked-resource-version="9" data-linked-resource-type="page">Lake monitoring DST</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> “Lag time module”: <a href="Lag-time-analysis_49348614.html" data-linked-resource-id="49348614" data-linked-resource-version="12" data-linked-resource-type="page">Lag time module</a> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="Statistical-analysis-module_119865345.html" data-linked-resource-id="119865345" data-linked-resource-version="14" data-linked-resource-type="page">Statistical analysis module</a> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMDF/pages/467795969/Riparian+Buffers+Case+Study" data-linked-resource-id="467795969" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Riparian Buffers Case Study</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="#_ftnref5" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMDF/pages/467795969/Riparian+Buffers+Case+Study" data-linked-resource-id="467795969" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Riparian Buffers Case Study</a> </p><p> </p>
