                    <p>The Our Land and Water (OLW) National Science Challenge (Toitū te Whenua Toiora te Wai) has a vision which looks to a future where catchments contain mosaics of land uses that are more resilient, healthy and prosperous than today. This is a future in which all New Zealanders can be proud of the state of our land and water and share the economic, environmental, social and cultural value that te Taiao offers.</p><p>Te Taiao is the environment that contains and surrounds us. It has four major components, Whenua (land), Wai (water), Āhuarangi (climate) and Koiora (all living communities). It encourages us to aspire to a future where humanity and the natural world sustain each other in an interconnected relationship of respect.</p><p>Large parts of New Zealand are dominated by single land uses that have put the wellbeing of our land, water, climate, and communities at risk. To underpin the vitality of te Taiao we require landscapes and catchments to be more diverse than they are today. When we use holistic models of assessment to consider what the land is most suited for, outcomes that support and reinforce the concept of vitality are improved. However, land stewards have difficulty envisaging the range of land use opportunities (both known and unknown) and weighing up the trade-offs in a holistic manner. Part of achieving vitality in our landscapes will require an understanding of how management practices interact with land and water, and how targeted interventions can be verified in a catchment context. Future landscapes will involve a mix of old and new land uses or practices. Some of the new land uses and practices don’t yet exist. Their emergence and uptake in combination with others relies on a mix of science that demonstrates the (economic, environmental, social and cultural) viability of mixed systems and those willing to take a chance on them. Without both elements working in tandem, nothing will change.</p><p>Three key areas of investigation in the Future Landscapes theme will provision land stewards with the information and tools required to achieve a diverse (and appropriate) mosaic of future land use.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flagship Concept: </strong>Providing tools for land stewards to assess diverse land use options, to identify the best land use to support the vitality of te Taiao</p></li><li><p><strong>Theme Impact by 2024</strong>: Decisions on land-use change and management practises can be made with confidence that they will lead to improvement in te Taiao</p></li><li><p><strong>Theme Impact by 2030</strong>: The vitality of te Taiao is improving in response to our decisions as land stewards </p></li></ul><p /><div
