                    <p>A monitoring network designed to detect change across a region should ideally be representative of the environments within the region of interest, with all environmental classes likely to be affected by the mitigation included proportionally to their occurrence across the region. An analysis of representativeness can used to identify the environmental classes that are under- or over-represented within an existing monitoring network and make recommendations about where new sites might be best situated to reduce network bias. </p><p>First, data from sites representing all environmental or geographic classes in the region should be included. If some classes are excluded, the overall estimated state or trend will be over-influenced by classes that are included. For example, a regional water quality analysis including agricultural and urban landcover classes but excluding forested landcover classes in the same region may erroneously indicate that water quality is substantially worse than the true region-wide state.</p><p>The second condition is that the number of monitoring sites from each environmental or geographic class, and the abundance of each class in the assessment area, should have the same proportions. This condition can be applied before compiling data (by selecting sites in proportion to the size of their environmental class) or after compiling data (by assigning a weighting factor to the data from each environmental class). For example, if lake-fed rivers comprise 20% of the total number of rivers (or 20% of the total river length) in an assessment area, lake-fed rivers should comprise 20% of the monitoring sites used for assessment. If these conditions are not met, rare environmental classes may have too much influence on estimated water quality and common classes may have too little influence. Proportionality factors available for use include:</p><ul><li><p>the number of segments in each environmental class as a proportion of total reach number,</p></li><li><p>the length of river channel in each class as a proportion of total river length,</p></li><li><p>the relative amount of river flow, or</p></li><li><p>the catchment area of a river as a proportion of total area.</p></li></ul><p>These considerations are particularly important when monitoring data are used for constructing statistical models that predict water quality at unmonitored sites (e.g., Whitehead, 2019). While such models can be useful for understanding patterns of water quality in areas with similar environmental characteristics to monitored sites, high uncertainty is often associated with predictions outside of the range of environmental classes that are monitored. This extrapolation issue can be reduced by ensuring that the environmental space is sampled as widely as possible.</p><p>The &quot;representative number of sites&quot; can be calculated as the product of the total number of existing sites and the proportion of river length or catchment area in each major environmental class. Current representativeness can then be quantified as the difference between the current number of sites in each environmental class and the representative number of sites. Positive values indicate that the class is over-represented and negative values indicate that the class is under-represented.</p><p>To facilitate interpretation, two types of under-representation are often distinguished: “gaps” where there are no monitoring sites in an environmental class, and “shortages” where there are too few sites to achieve a minimum statistical power for a given variable. Note that gaps are defined in terms of presence or absence of sites, not in terms of the range of variables measured.</p><p>We provide an example of spatial representativeness analysis in the groundwater case study: <a href="Network-representativeness-analysis_479264997.html" data-linked-resource-id="479264997" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Network representativeness analysis</a> </p><h2 id="Spatialrepresentationanalysis-References">References</h2><p>Whitehead, A.L.
