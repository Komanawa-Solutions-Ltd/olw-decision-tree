                    <p>A literature review of freshwater restoration/improvement and associated monitoring was undertaken, with a particular focus on:</p><p>·      Whether monitoring was part of the mitigation/restoration plan;</p><p>·      Where monitoring was present, how it was designed and;</p><p>·      What conclusions were drawn from the monitoring data</p><p>·      Key conclusions and recommendations from the authors.</p><p /><p>In addition, the Essential Freshwater package was gazetted in September 2020, i.e. during the early phases of the project. The project’s expression of interest document requires that the work “be consistent with the freshwater legislative framework at the time of writing the outputs”. Accordingly, the Essential Freshwater Package was reviewed, with a focus on restoration/improvement and monitoring requirements. </p>
