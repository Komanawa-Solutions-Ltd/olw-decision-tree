                    <p>Because the FCI analysis for Kaiapoi River indicate that it will not be possible to determine the effectiveness of the mitigation with a sufficient degree of certainty by monitoring at that site, upstream monitoring sites are likely to be required. The spatial distribution analysis process is used to identify the number of monitoring sites required and to evaluate the requirements for collecting samples which are representative of the target population (see discussion below). </p><p>Determination of the mitigation monitoring area (e.g. a catchment or a flow path between the mitigation area and downgradient receptors) is the first step in the process. This case study uses the area shown in Figure 4‑8 below for illustrative purposes, noting that is not the true catchment area of the Kaiapoi River monitoring site. </p><p>The second and third steps in the spatial distribution analysis process are to determine the expected nitrogen loss reduction for the proposed mitigation within the catchment area, and to evaluate the spatial variability in both nitrate loss rates and the expected rate reductions within the area.</p><p>The notified version of proposed Plan Change 7 of the Canterbury Land and Water Regional Plan sets out a 15% nitrate loss reduction for dairy farms and 5% for other land uses which require a land use consent under the LWRP (e.g. sheep, beef, deer, horticulture, pig farming). These nitrate loss reductions are applied to the mapped land use for the mitigation monitoring area to generate a layer from which the loss reduction mean and standard deviation can be calculated.  </p><p>The fourth and fifth steps in the process are to 4) determine the ELT requirement for the monitoring site(s) and 5) develop a preliminary monitoring design and use the time series and spatial power analysis tools to determine the likelihood of successful mitigation monitoring via the preliminary design.   </p><p>Although we have not included step four in this case study due to time constraints, the method is demonstrated in the <em><strong>Step 3: Time series power analysis</strong></em> section above. The ELT could be determined by age tracer sampling in a selection of monitoring wells covering a range of depths and locations. The time series nitrate concentration standard deviation could be determined from existing monitoring wells. Implementation of the Step 3 process would then help to identify the ELT requirements for determination of the effectiveness of mitigation within a specified time frame, and wells selected accordingly. By way of example, the process might show that an ELT of 6 years is required, with the age tracer sampling and analysis showing that wells screened within 2 m of the water table would generally achieve this. The monitoring network design would therefore need to include wells which meet this criteria.</p><p>Step 5 of spatial distribution analysis process comprises use of time series and spatial power analysis tools to determine the likelihood of successful mitigation monitoring via a preliminary monitoring network design. We have used Environment Canterbury’s 16 groundwater quality wells in this area as the preliminary network (see Figure 1) for this case study.</p><p>We have assumed for current purposes that nitrate sampled from a well is representative of the land use within which it is located. In reality this is unlikely to be either entirely the case, or the case at all, especially where the monitoring wells is relatively deep and located downgradient of a different land use to that within which it is located. Monitoring well recharge area analysis would be required to provide a foundation for more robust spatial distribution evaluation.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="566" loading="lazy" src="attachments/479494295/479264978.png?width=566" data-image-src="attachments/479494295/479264978.png" data-height="286" data-width="425" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="479264978" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="The current landuse in the Waimakariri Zone .png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="479494295" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" data-media-id="74303eb3-1c3e-433a-b274-081bbfc080a0" data-media-type="file"></span><p /><p>Figure 1. The current landuse in the Waimakariri Zone with respect to sixteen existing State of the Environment (SOE) monitoring wells and 2381 private wells.</p><p>A significant number of private water supply wells are present within this catchment area, as shown in Figure 1. We have included an illustration of how the spatial distribution analysis can be used to assess the whether the existing monitoring is likely to provide representative data for determination of the effectiveness of nitrate loss mitigations on nitrate concentrations in private wells, as an extension to the case study described above.</p><p>The spatial data power analysis uses mean and standard deviation nitrate concentrations as inputs for determination of the number of sites required to obtain a statistically robust sample of the population. Whilst these metrics could be determined from a soil leaching nitrate concentration layer (e.g. derived from Overseer™ modelling), it is possible that this would overestimate the variance of groundwater nitrate concentrations (and hence the number of monitoring sites required) due to the possible smoothing effect of mixing and dilution processes in groundwater. Further work could be undertaken to explore this. For the Waimakariri case study we have used water table nitrate concentration data generated via a groundwater model. Model data were readily available for a status quo model run (referred to as Current management Practise, CMP) and a Good Management Practice + 20% Dairy, which simulates groundwater nitrate concentrations following implementation of GMP and with dairy farms having reduced nitrate losses by 20%. Although this differs slightly from the proposed Plan Change 7 mitigation requirements, it is still useful for demonstration of the mitigation monitoring design process. Figure 2 below shows modelled groundwater nitrate concentrations for these two scenarios. The lower figure shows the difference between the CMP and GMP + 20% Dairy concentration layers.</p><p>We assessed the ability of the current monitoring network to detect the expected reduction in nitrate across the region using an analytical power analysis, where the mean and standard deviation were based on the CMP modelled nitrate layer and assuming a Type I error of 0.05. Figure 3 shows that the power available to detect a reduction in nitrate increases as the magnitude of the reduction and/or the number of monitoring wells increases.</p><p>The existing monitoring network is unlikely to detect the median expected change in nitrate (power = 0.264). Based on this analysis, a minimum of 100 sites would be required to detect a 20% reduction in dairy farm nitrate leaching. A median reduction in nitrate leaching of at least 47% would be required to provide 80% confidence of detecting the reduction via the existing 16 monitoring sites.</p><p>Installation and maintenance of 100 monitoring sites would be expensive, possibly prohibitively so (although the cost of implementing mitigation measures which later prove to be ineffective or significantly less effective than expected would also need to be considered in these circumstances).  Targeted mitigation monitoring sites could potentially be installed to reduce monitoring costs. The process for identifying targeted sites would be similar to the spatial distribution analysis process described previously, but focused on the areas immediately downstream of the mitigation areas:</p><ol><li><p>Map land areas where mitigations are proposed</p></li><li><p>Evaluate the spatial variability in nitrate loss reductions for these areas</p></li><li><p>Use the power analysis approach described above to determine the number of sites required</p></li><li><p>Use knowledge of ELT requirements and flow paths between nitrate sources and groundwater monitoring locations to identify potential monitoring sites</p></li></ol><p>For step 2 a more detailed analysis of local-scale variability in nitrate loss mitigation and integration of local on-farm knowledge of land use practices would be required for the monitoring network design.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" width="618" loading="lazy" src="attachments/479494295/479232225.png?width=618" data-image-src="attachments/479494295/479232225.png" data-height="579" data-width="414" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="479232225" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Modelled groundwater nitrat.png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="479494295" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" data-media-id="fbb7a36a-2567-4ea1-bdf8-443bd214b5bd" data-media-type="file"></span><p /><p>Figure 2.

The expected change in nitrate (mg/L) (B) represents the difference between the two scenarios, with nitrate predicted to decrease across most of the region. Modelled concentration increases are due to an increase in irrigation efficiency under GMP that reduces dilution and increases nitrate concentrations.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="680" loading="lazy" src="attachments/479494295/481755158.png?width=680" data-image-src="attachments/479494295/481755158.png" data-height="286" data-width="425" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="481755158" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="he power available .png" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="479494295" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" data-media-id="c27d8aea-5ad5-40a3-b6e7-02795e80d139" data-media-type="file"></span><p>Figure 3.
