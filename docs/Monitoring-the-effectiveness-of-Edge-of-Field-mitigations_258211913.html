                    <p><strong>Monitoring effectiveness of constructed wetlands and similar edge-of-field mitigations for reducing contaminant loads in diffuse agricultural runoff</strong></p><p>Chris Tanner, NIWA</p><p>30.03.21</p><p><strong>Monitoring challenges</strong></p><ul><li><p>Highly variable diffuse surface and subsurface inflows/outflows and associated contaminant concentrations and loads.</p></li><li><p>Efficacy of edge-of-field mitigations (EFM) highly influenced by the timing and magnitude of inflowing loads which can differ markedly from day-to-day, season-to-season and year-to-year. EMF performance governed by hydraulic residence time at the scale of hours and days, linked to longer-term biogeochemical cycles.</p></li><li><p>Outlet flows differ from inflows due to storage in wetland, associated time lags and losses/gains from rainfall, evapotranspiration, and infiltration/exfiltration.</p></li><li><p>Where a significant proportion of inflows are surface run-off or channelised drainage flows a high proportion of contaminants are likely to be particulate associated. These are often preferentially transported in first-flush pulses and extreme high-flows.</p></li><li><p>Nature-based mitigation systems typically take a number of years to establish and reach maturity. For instance, net plant nutrient uptake in constructed wetlands may be substantial during establishment but then reduce once vegetation has matured, while microbial denitrification may initially be limited by availability of organic C until sufficient decomposing plant litter has had time to accumulate. In contrast, woodchip bioreactors may initially produce excess organic C, which reduces to a steadier supply.</p></li><li><p>Natural cycles of wetting/drying, growth, senescence, decomposition and associated cycling/spiralling of carbon and nutrients within and between plants/litter/soil, mean that uptake and release of nutrients and contaminants can be highly variable and out of phase. Examples include: sediment associated phosphorus that settles in the wetland and may later desorb and be released as in dissolved forms; a proportion of inorganic nutrients taken up by plants may later release in organic and inorganic forms when they die-back.</p></li><li><p>Temperature and prior biogeochemical history can affect some removal processes, e.g. microbial denitrification and plant assimilation rates slower at low temperature; seasonally dry systems may take some time to recover full function.</p></li><li><p>·         EFM often implemented at remote sites. Sampling requires operation of telemetered loggers, automatic samplers etc via solar power systems. Loss of any part of dataset, significantly impacts on data quality, e.g. gap in in or out-flow means net load removal cannot be calculated. Water samples for many attributes need to be measured before changes take place; usually within 24 hrs of collection or 48 hrs if refrigerated samplers used.</p></li></ul><p><br/><strong>Implications for monitoring</strong></p><p>Low-frequency (e.g., monthly) monitoring of contaminant concentrations in inflows and outflows is unlikely to be sufficient to be able to usefully quantify and compare performance, except possibly where stable spring-flows dominate. Such sampling is not suitable for flashy flows, where regular sampling is likely to miss the high flow events that dominate contaminant load export.</p><ul><li><p>Need to monitor flows and concentrations of contaminants in inflows and outflows, including groundwater inputs and outputs if significant. There is potential to simplify hydrology using impermeable liners to minimise groundwater losses or gains, but this may not then reflect actual in-situ performance.</p></li><li><p>Need to specifically target monitoring of high flow events as well as base-flows. Flows will often be linked to rainfall events, highly seasonal and may be only active for 3-9 months of the year.</p></li><li><p>Need to measure performance once system is mature (1-2 growth seasons) for 3 years plus to get a reasonable estimate of performance</p></li><li><p>Maintaining proper functioning of monitoring gear in remote sites and targeting of high-flow events ideally requires regularly-checked  telemetered automated loggers and sampling systems so problems can be quickly identified, sampling can be triggered, and timing for efficient sample collection can be determined).</p></li><li><p>Optical spectrometric probes (e.g. for nitrate) offer major advantages for high frequency monitoring, but care needs to be taken due to potential interferences from other constituents causing changes in background absorbance e.g. humic compounds that are either mobilised or diluted during high flow events.</p></li><li><p>Costs for setting up and monitoring performance of edge-of-field mitigation systems are likely to be high and time frames relatively long. This provides significant incentive to implement specially targeted monitoring programmes to enable development and calibration of simplified performance models that can then be applied to estimate expected performance across multiple sites.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sampling approaches</strong></p><p>Simple monitoring approaches may be suitable for stable flows where most contaminants are transported in baseflows. Greater effort is required to accurately quantify contaminant removal performance under variable flows where contaminants are transported preferentially during high-flow events. Table 1 shows a generalised hierarchy of monitoring effectiveness for EFM with either stable or variable flows. Generally, the ability to quantify contaminant load reductions will increase markedly with addition of flow monitoring and increased frequency of monitoring. High frequency monitoring of parameters such as turbidity can provide useful proxies for contaminants that are particulate-associated or behave similarly. Likewise, electrical conductivity can act as a proxy for dissolved contaminants. Optical spectrometric probes (e.g. for nitrate) can provide high frequency data if suitably calibrated.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Table 1: Hierarchy of monitoring effort to quantify contaminant load

denitrification filters.</strong></p><p>It is preferable to focus monitoring attention on systems that are efficient to monitor, i.e. preferably with a single inflow and outflow point. It is recommended that inlets and outlets of EFMs are monitored for 2-3 years (at very least 1 year) after implementation. Where inflows and associated contaminant loads are variable at least 3-5 high flow events per year should also be specifically monitored through the hydrograph using automated samplers and/or high frequency proxies. These can be collected either flow proportionally or at set time intervals. Once the general flow regime of the site is known, flow proportional composite sampling may be able to be used for event sampling to reduce sample numbers and analytical costs.</p><p><strong>Surface flows</strong></p><ul><li><p>Flow should ideally be measured continuously at the inflow and outflow to get accurate flow measurements. This typically needs a weir or flume (and sufficient head available to avoid them being drowned out during high flows) and a stage recorder in a stilling well to accurately measure the depth behind them. Alternatively, an ultrasonic doppler meter can be used, but accuracy will typically be poorer. Where automated flow measurements are not possible manual gauging of inflows and outflows should be done at the time of sampling (ideally fortnightly, minimum monthly) using a V-notch weir with graduated level or by field gauging using a flow velocity meter on a stable straight section of channel<a href="#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It may also be possible to calibrate grab measurements of flow to nearby continuous stream flow records to interpolate the flow record, assuming reasonable correlation can be established. Such relationships would likely need to be supplemented by targeted high-flow and possibly also low-flow measurements, which may be missed by regular sampling.</p></li><li><p>Depending on how variable the flow regime, fortnightly (ideal) or monthly grab samples should be collected in clean pre-rinsed bottles (sterile for E coli) at the inlet and outlet and transported to the laboratory in an ice-filled container within 24 hours of collection. Samples for dissolved nutrients should ideally be filtered in the field before transport back to the laboratory to ensure that significant microbial and geochemical changes do not occur.</p><ul><li><p>Unfiltered (&gt;0.45µ) TN, TP, <em>E. coli</em></p></li><li><p>Filtered (&lt;0.45 µ) NH<sub>4</sub>-N, NO<sub>2/3</sub>-N, TDP, DRP</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Groundwater flows</strong></p><p>Where groundwater gains or losses are significant, they ideally need to be measured and sampled in space and time too.
