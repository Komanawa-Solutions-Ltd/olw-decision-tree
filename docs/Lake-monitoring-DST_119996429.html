                    <p /><p>Lake restoration is an ambitious goal (Zohary 2019) and the results of many restoration efforts have often been disappointing, sometimes associated with little change in lake ecology or in other cases by temporary improvement followed by a rapid reversion to degraded conditions (Moss 2019). Many restoration efforts have been poorly monitored, creating uncertainty in the responses to actions and the efficacy of the investment. Monitoring through the restoration process is critical because replication at lake scale is rarely viable. Monitoring is essential to ascertain a pre-restoration baseline, any short-term (acute) response, including any adverse impacts, to the restoration action, and the longevity of the treatment, including any legacy effects.</p><p>The updated (2020) National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (NPS-FM) provides direction to local authorities about managing freshwater under the Resource Management Act 1991. It requires that all practicable steps are taken to reduce uncertainty in freshwater assessments by providing robust data, taking steps to improve monitoring, and validating models with suitable data. Policy 13 of the NPSFM 2020 requires that “The condition of water bodies and freshwater ecosystems is systematically monitored over time, and action is taken where freshwater is degraded, and to reverse deteriorating trends”. Lakes are a particular focal point for restoration and require implementation of reliable, consistent monitoring programmes that are comparable between catchments, regions and across the country. The needs for restoration is evidenced by concerns about the state of lakes; between 2007 and 2016, 33 percent of monitored lakes were in excellent or high ecological condition, 31 percent were in moderate condition, and 36 percent were in poor ecological condition or were entirely without submerged plants. It should be noted, however, that of the 3800 lakes in New Zealand with area less than 1 hectare, less than 5% have any form of consistent monitoring.</p><p>In-lake mitigation should form part of a lake catchment mitigation plan and needs to be aligned with a catchment mitigation plan. Inability to achieve such an alignment is one of the reasons for reversion of lake condition to the pre in-lake intervention condition mentioned above.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="453" loading="lazy" src="attachments/119996429/262963241?width=453" data-image-src="attachments/119996429/262963241" data-height="792" data-width="1119" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="262963241" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="0_0?a=302&amp;x=129&amp;y=-1016&amp;w=1119&amp;h=792&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2062af7b66d58e776dee161ba4696041a39e5ad864-ts%3D1609991623" data-base-url="https://olw-decision-tree.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="119996429" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="63fedbfb-ce96-4a5b-882d-fc03c596d945" data-media-type="file"></span><p />
