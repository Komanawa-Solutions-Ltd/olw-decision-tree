                    <p>In partnership with central government, the Our Land and Water (OLW) National Science Challenge (Toitū te Whenua Toiora te Wai) convened a series of “scoping” workshops and hui in February and March 2020, assembling a range of Stakeholders, potential end-users, and experts in freshwater, land management and Mātauranga Māori.</p><p>These workshops identified critical knowledge gaps in the design of environmental monitoring capable of verifying the impact of action on the ground as well as the most appropriate technologies for facilitating verification of actions. Consequently, OLW established three streams of work within its Future Landscapes research theme:</p><p><u>Working group 1</u>: Monitoring Design: The design of environmental monitoring programmes to enable a holistic and more certain understanding of freshwater outcomes resulting from land management actions taken within a catchment or a freshwater management unit (FMU).</p><p><u>Working group 2</u>: Monitoring Technology Defining what technologies are available (or soon will be) that can be successfully used for the measurement of holistic freshwater values, as related to freshwater use or contaminant discharge; with specific regard to how useful these technologies would be for regulating water use or contaminant discharge.</p><p><u>Working Group 3</u>: Enacting Te Mana o te Wai through mātauranga Māori. Ensuring the integrity of Te Mana o te Wai is upheld, supporting the mauri of our wai to thrive and flourish through creating the infrastructure and tools needed to ensure that Te Mana o te Wai is given effect in its implementation and how it is able to lead monitoring of freshwater quantity and quality through the mana whenua of that place/ waters.</p><p /><p />
