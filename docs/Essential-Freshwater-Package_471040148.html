                    <p>The “Essential Freshwater” package refers to a suite of rules and regulations released by the New Zealand government in September 2020. The package introduces new rules and regulations to:</p><ul><li><p>stop further degradation of New Zealand’s freshwater resources and improve water quality within five years</p></li><li><p>reverse past damage and bring New Zealand’s freshwater resources, waterways and ecosystems to a healthy state within a generation.</p></li></ul><p>New National Environmental Standards for Freshwater and a new National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management aim at preventing further loss and degradation of freshwater habitats and introduce controls on some high-risk activities. These came into force on 3 September 2020, along with new stock exclusion regulations and regulations that require real-time reporting for water-takes data.</p><p>The Essential Freshwater package was gazetted in September 2020, i.e. during the early phases of the project. The project’s expression of interest document requires that the work “be consistent with the freshwater legislative framework at the time of writing the outputs”. Accordingly, the Essential Freshwater Package was reviewed, with a focus on restoration/improvement and monitoring requirements. Details of this review can be found here:  <a href="2020-Essential-Freshwater-Package_435028005.html" data-linked-resource-id="435028005" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">2020 Essential Freshwater Package</a> </p><p />
