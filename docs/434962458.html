                    <p><strong>Restoration as a practice</strong></p><p>River restoration is widely employed worldwide, attempting to bring running water ecosystems to more natural conditions, compared to the degraded conditions they were led to by human activities. River restoration projects usually focus on improving water quality, in-stream habitat, fish passage and bank stability (Bernhardt et al., 2005). The numbers of such projects are only expected to rise, as the effect of human interventions in the environment continues to increase and the overarching effect of climate change is expected to lead to altered flow and sediment regimes, with the rivers’ potential to adapt to such changes being unknown (Palmer et al., 2007).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Restoration outcomes</strong></p><p>Restoration outcomes do not always prove its success in improving the state of the managed ecosystems. Results appear to differ with regards to restoration method, organism group or abiotic factors targeted, timing of restoration, time since restoration implementation etc., but also within groups designated by these categories (Kail et al., 2015). Some projects show improvement and are deemed successful (Kail et al., 2015), while others show no change, or show unclear results (Griffith et al., 2020; Morandi et al., 2014). Restoration managers often deem their projects as successful based on “gut feeling”, while the projects are often considered “condemned to success”, because a failed project could be considered as a waste of money, leading to its cessation (Jahning et al., 2011). Success criteria might simply be unsuitable for the evaluation of restoration outcomes, as they might just repeat the project design (e.g. replant 1000 meters along the streambanks) or they might be non-measurable (e.g. restore the channel to its natural conditions, Bernhardt et al., 2007).</p><p> </p><p><strong>General problem: absence/inadequacy of monitoring. Monitoring definition.</strong></p><p>The need for monitoring restoration outcomes in a measurable way is self-evident. It can help focus resources where they will be most effective (England et al., 2008). Monitoring describes multiple types of surveying phenomena, such as baseline, status, trend, implementation, effectiveness and validation monitoring. Surveillance, operation and investigative monitoring research trends in aquatic ecosystems’ quality, detect needs for or results of restoration measures, and try to reveal causal relationships where results of such measures are unexpected and inexplainable (Weber et al., 2018). However, while there are large amounts of funds and effort put into the implementation of restoration projects, these are not matched by equally comprehensive monitoring programmes (Bernhardt et al., 2005), and time limitations are also put forward as an explanation for lack of monitoring (Kondolf et al., 2007).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Reasons for failed/absent monitoring schemes:</strong></p><p>The problem with monitoring is not always its lack per se (Jungwirth et al., 2002), but lack of systematic and objective assessment and subsequent reporting of restoration outcomes (Kondolf et al., 2007). A problem that is shared by many restoration monitoring schemes, is their generalised nature. Without specific and targeted monitoring, that focuses on specific aspects of the ecosystem, it is difficult to accurately evaluate changes elicited by restoration actions (Guy et al., 2018). Additionally, monitoring designs often do not rely on solid mathematical criteria, but rather only on appearance and public-opinion related (Bernhardt et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2019). There is a lack of practical motivation and political support; funding agencies might provide sufficient funds only for the implementation of restoration actions, but not for their monitoring and evaluation stages. Whilst considerable amounts of funding are often directed towards restoration programs at a regional or national level, they are not always coupled by equally coordinated monitoring, which instead is performed (if ever) at a project level (Weber et al., 2018). Stakeholders and landowners might even be intimidated by a lack of privacy and confidentiality (Doehring et al., 2020).</p><p>Additionally, specific guidelines on how to plan and implement such programs might not be available, or even basic comprehension of the necessity for post-restoration monitoring might be lacking (Weber et al., 2018). Not well-thought restoration programmes with unclear or contradictory goals, will, irrespective of the suitability of their monitoring schemes, lead to misinformed evaluations (Howard-Williams &amp; Pickmere, 2010). Restoration monitoring without a reference to compare the restored sites to, will be unsuitable for evaluating the improvement attributed to restoration actions (Smucker &amp; Detenbeck, 2014). Routine monitoring might miss changes caused by restoration actions, as the effect might be too small and require more focused monitoring to be detected, multiple restoration actions might have confounding effects on the ecosystem components, baseline data might be limited and monitored characteristics naturally variable (Rubin et al., 2017). On the other hand, poorly designed monitoring schemes can also lead to biased results, with a sense of robustness in their conclusions, while better designed schemes might give more ambiguous, but also better-grounded results (Morandi et al., 2014). The spatial scale on which restoration actions and subsequent monitoring schemes are based can be inappropriate; if the degrading factor(s) persist across the catchment of the restored reach, then restoration focusing only on the latter is likely to fail. The temporal scale and timing intervals of monitoring can also fail to reveal changes in the biotic or abiotic characteristics of the ecosystem (Doehring et al., 2019; Graham et al., 2018; Holmes et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2010; Wohl et al., 2005). Changes in different components of the restored ecosystems (e.g. water quality variables, geomorphology variables, biotic communities) progress at a different rate (Doehring et al., 2020) and in cases where monitoring merely comprises a one-off study, change trends are naturally difficult to detect (Parkyn et al., 2003). Small sample size in both temporal and spatial scales can be confounded by the natural variability among stream characteristics (Doehring et al., 2019; Parkyn et al., 2003).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Results from failed/absent monitoring:</strong></p><p>Non-implementation of restoration monitoring means, first and foremost, that no solid lessons are learned, from either successful or failed restoration projects (Bernhardt et al., 2005). Additionally, failed restoration, without any insight with regards to the reasons of failure, will also fail to maintain the support from stakeholders and the local community, potentially being considered a lost cause and a waste of money (Jahning et al., 2011).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Recommendations:   </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Pre-restoration/Monitoring network design:</strong></p><p>With a focus on ecology, Palmer et al. (2005) proposed five criteria to evaluate restoration success; 1) a guiding image is required, that will take in account the dynamic nature of river ecosystems (e.g. historical photos, reference sites etc.); 2) surveyed ecological variables need to be measurable and approach the guiding image ones post-restoration; post-restoration the river becomes more resilient without ongoing management actions; 3) restoration actions do not cause at the same time irreparable harm to other components of the ecosystem; 4) monitoring of the ecosystem is performed pre- and post-restoration.</p><p>There is no “one-size-fits-all” method to design a monitoring network for river ecosystems (Nguyen et al., 2019), and a suitable design is of outmost importance, to give accurate insight into the effect of restoration on ecosystem health (Jiang et al., 2020). Bernhardt et al. (2007) suggested that within a national restoration program, every restoration project should be followed by implementation monitoring, to evaluate whether the restoration interventions perform as expected. Outcome monitoring, evaluating whether restoration goals are accomplished, cannot be implemented for every project, and instead a subset of restoration projects should be monitored, determined by sample size and power estimates (Roni et al., 2015).</p><p>Selection of a particular monitoring scheme should also take in account the scale of the project to be monitored, the novelty of techniques used in the project and the consequent risk and uncertainty from management of certain ecosystem components (England et al., 2008). Weber et al. (2018) proposed a framework for Programmatic river monitoring and evaluation (ProME), aiming at four general goals: i) monitoring designs should account for complexity, uncertainty and long-term change in the restored ecosystems (Kail et al., 2015; Wohl et al., 2005), ii) promote collaborative learning among stakeholders and adaptive management/monitoring (Caruso, 2006; Kondolf et al., 2007), iii) evaluate the level of success that the restoration actions had, and iv) infer causal relationships between elements of the environment and the effect that restoration actions have on them. Accomplishment of these goals will be based on nine principles: assurance of stakeholders’ continuous commitment and involvement, setting clear objectives (Caruso, 2006; Howard-Williams &amp; Pickmere, 2010; Palmer et al., 2007), coordination of different sectors that are related to the restored ecosystems, setting clear key-questions from practice to be answered systematically based on the newest project, standardization of sampling design (Kondolf et al., 2007), include multiple replicate projects, distribute funds on a cost-benefit basis (England et al., 2008), results’ dissemination to the stakeholders and the people directly or indirectly affected by these projects and, finally, reflection and adaptation based on the gained results, at regular intervals. Inclusion of the public should not be limited only to results dissemination post-restoration, but practitioners should also ask for input from the public whose life and work will be affected by the restoration (Kondolf et al., 2007).</p><p>Restoration monitoring should ideally be based on a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, where, apart from the restored ecosystems, reference ecosystems (unimpacted) and control ecosystems (impacted but unrestored) will also be studied pre- and post-restoration (England et al., 2008; Jungwirth et al., 2002; Weber et al., 2018). A conceptual reference model can be developed, upon which success criteria will based (Rubin et al., 2017). In the absence of suitable reference and control data, existing gradients, established criteria and ecological relationships, and historical data can be helpful (Smucker &amp; Detenbeck, 2014).</p><p>In watershed restoration programs, treatments can be staggered in time (Roni et al., 2015). In such cases, a variation of the BACI design can be employed, the Hierarchical Staircase Statistical Design, which uses untreated reaches as controls until they are treated and allows for separation of random year effects from year by treatment interactions (Roni et al., 2015). Monitoring sites can be selected with the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified method, which treats streams as continuous and selects sites with random and systematic properties, taking in account the proportion of features of interest in them, covering the entire network (Roni et al., 2015).</p><p>The characteristics selected for monitoring need to be valid, widely used and accessible, performance-based, comprehensible, clearly defined and standardized, linked to the restoration goals, measured at the right spatiotemporal scale and accepted by stakeholders (Convertino et al., 2013; Doehring et al., 2020; Jungwirth et al., 2002; Wohl et al., 2005). Variables structuring the community in natural ecosystems, such as habitat heterogeneity, might not have an equally primary role in the transition of the community post-restoration (Miller et al., 2010; Palmer et al., 2010). Convertino et al. (2013) suggested multi-criteria decision analysis methods (MCDA) for systematic, quantitative and transparent selection of monitoring metrics, based on their utility value for stakeholders and weighted based on the relative importance of defined criteria. Probabilistic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis is an appropriate MCDA method, as it also considers probability distributions for weights, and it is suitable for highly uncertain data and high stakeholder involvement (Convertino et al., 2013).</p><p>Monitoring needs to cover multiple aspects of the ecosystem (biotic, abiotic, socioeconomic) and its timeframe needs to be long enough and in relevant intervals to detect changes incurred by the restoration actions and potentially include larger, infrequent events (Caruso, 2006; Jahning et al., 2011; Jungwirth et al., 2002; Kondolf et al., 2007; Wohl et al., 2005). Riparian forest restoration can show effects on water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates more than 10 years post-restoration (Wohl et al., 2015). Long-term monitoring will also give insight into the sustainability of the restoration scheme, i.e. whether restoration actions and materials lead to the required physical and ecological outcomes in the long-term (England et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2007). However, for restoration projects that are expected to cause rapid changes within a couple of years, spatial replication is generally better (Roni et al., 2015). Apart from the biotic elements, which are often the main focus of restoration projects but can be affected by additional factors, the effects on physical function, such as hydrology and geomorphology, ned to be monitored as well (Kondolf et al., 2007).</p><p>As funding can be scarce for the monitoring stages, the suggested plan should assure stakeholders and funding bodies about its validity via a careful estimation of the costs, in comparison to alternative actions, as well as a trial run (Weber et al., 2018).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Post-restoration/Monitoring implementation:</strong></p><p>It is possible that restoration outcomes will be too small to be detected or to be considered significant within a short time, but determining and modelling the post-restoration direction of an ecosystem can be accomplished via Bayesian belief methods, fuzzy cognitive mapping or weight of evidence approach (Solana-Gutierrex et al., 2017; Wohl et al., 2005). Standardized data recording systems need to be developed by restoration practitioners, and findings’/outcome reporting needs to be mandatory to secure funding (Bernhardt et al., 2007; Brooks et al., 2007; Jahning et al., 2011). Databases containing information on restoration projects should also include sections with information on project monitoring (Bernhardt et al., 2007). Interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists, managers and practitioners will greatly improve future restoration projects (Bernhardt et al., 2007). Dissemination of results should not depend on success or failure of the project, as valuable insight can be gained from both outcomes, provided adequate monitoring (England et al., 2008). In cases of complex relationships between stressors and environmental components, a combination of in- and out-of-channel restoration actions might have been implemented, and consequently monitoring should cover both types of habitat (Collier, 2017). Traditional knowledge and culture, along with socio-ecological perspectives should be incorporated to define the guiding image (Collier et al., 2017; Rubin et al., 2017).</p><p /><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="wide" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 66.0px;"/><col style="width: 431.0px;"/><col style="width: 463.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>#</strong></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Publication</strong></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Overview – Recommendations</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>1</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>M Guy, G Cooper, M Todd, W McKay, S Boyte, M Owen and J Roygard (2018).
