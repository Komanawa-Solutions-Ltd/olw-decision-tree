olw-decision-tree
===================

This github repo captures the outcomes of the Our Land and Water decision tree confluence space, but has been restructured to be more accessible to the public and to be more easily maintained.

This Confluence space provides a repository for the resources and examples developed as part of Stage 1 of the Mitigation Effectiveness Monitoring Design Framework project. Note that this space was created to support the project and provide a resource point for the project team. It is not intended to be a comprehensive resource for all things related to decision tree and is provided here in an as-is state.

The main point of entry to this space is:

.. TODO - add link to main page

We have also included a copy of the decision tree space as an xml export in the `confluence-export` directory. This is provided as a backup and for reference only. It is not intended to be used as a standalone resource.
